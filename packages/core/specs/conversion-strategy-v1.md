# OSQR Conversion Strategy
## Version 1.1 | From Trial to Paid to Retained

---

## Document Purpose

This document defines how OSQR converts users across its pricing journey:
- **Trial → Paid** (14-day Pro trial via referral)
- **Lite → Pro** (post-1,000 users)
- **Pro → Master** (power user upgrade)

The approach centers on demonstrated value and natural upgrade moments - never pressure tactics or artificial scarcity.

---

## Pricing Reality (As Specced)

### Launch Tiers

| Tier | Price | Future Price | Key Unlock |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Pro** | $99/mo | $149/mo | Full OSQR experience |
| **Master** | $249/mo | $349/mo | Council Mode, priority support |
| **Master Annual** | $199/mo | — | All Master features, 2 months free |

### Post-1,000 Users

| Tier | Price | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Lite** | $19/mo | Entry funnel, conversion driver |

### Trial Mechanics

- 14-day Pro trial via referral (costs nothing, creates word-of-mouth)
- No free tier at launch
- Founder pricing locked for first 500 users

---

## Conversion Philosophy

### Core Principle

**Upgrading OSQR is like transitioning from a talented freelancer to a full-time Chief of Staff.**

A freelancer (Lite/Trial) is great for one-off tasks, but they don't remember how you like your coffee or the history of your projects. You don't "hire" the Chief of Staff (Pro/Master) because they are "scarcely available," but because you need someone who has:

- **A permanent desk** (Persistent Memory)
- **Your office rules** (Trained on your patterns)
- **Keys to the building** (Full integration access)

### What We Avoid

| Tactic | Why We Don't Use It |
|--------|---------------------|
| Countdown timers | Creates artificial pressure |
| "Limited time" pricing | Dishonest if not actually limited |
| Feature walls mid-task | Punishing, breaks flow |
| Aggressive pop-ups | Damages relationship |
| "Last chance" messaging | Manipulative |
| Dark patterns | Against constitutional values |

### What We Do Use

| Approach | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Value demonstration first | They know what they're buying |
| Natural pause points | Upgrade when task complete, not mid-flow |
| Transparent comparison | Clear tier differences |
| OSQR's honest framing | Companion suggesting, not vendor selling |
| Founder pricing lock | Legitimate urgency - early users keep their rate |
| Memory as the wedge | Free/Lite forgets; Paid remembers everything |

---

## The Upgrade Journey

### Stage 1: First Value (Day 1)

**Goal:** User experiences "aha" moment in first session

**What Creates "Aha":**
- OSQR demonstrates contextual intelligence (not just chat)
- User realizes OSQR can interact with their actual work
- First insight that connects dots they hadn't seen

**OSQR behavior:**
- Delivers unexpected value immediately
- Does NOT mention tiers or pricing
- Focus entirely on demonstration

**Conversion action:** None - build trust first

---

### Stage 2: Habit Formation (Days 2-7)

**Goal:** User returns and engages repeatedly

**Trigger:** Second or third session

**OSQR behavior:**
- Welcomes back, references previous conversations
- Demonstrates memory value ("Last time you mentioned...")
- Builds the pattern of OSQR as thinking partner

**Conversion action:** Light framing only if trial is ending

> "We've been working together for a week now. I've learned a lot about how you think. Want to keep this going?"

---

### Stage 3: Capability Discovery (Days 7-14)

**Goal:** User discovers features that require higher tiers

**Trigger:** User attempts Council Mode or hits Pro limits

**OSQR behavior:**
- Shows WHAT they're missing (not just that they're missing something)
- Explains the capability, not the paywall

**Conversion action:** Honest capability framing

> "That's a Council Mode question - I'd bring in multiple models to debate it. That's a Master feature. Want me to try with what I have, or is this worth the upgrade?"

---

### Stage 4: Trial End / Upgrade Decision

**Goal:** Frictionless conversion at natural moment

**Trigger:** Trial approaching end OR user indicates interest

**OSQR behavior:**
- Proactive but not pushy
- Summarizes what they'd lose vs. keep
- Makes the decision easy

**Conversion action:** Clear, simple choice

> "Your trial ends tomorrow. Here's what changes if you don't continue:
>
> - I forget our conversation history
> - You lose access to Thoughtful and Contemplate modes
> - Document limit drops to Lite levels
>
> Pro is $99/month. Want to keep going?"

---

### Stage 5: Post-Conversion (Retention)

**Goal:** Validate the purchase immediately

**Trigger:** Payment completed

**OSQR behavior:**
- Immediately demonstrates Pro/Master value
- Surfaces held-back insights
- Makes them feel smart for upgrading

**Conversion action:** Reinforce the decision

> "Good call. Let me show you what I can do now..."
> 
> [Runs deeper analysis, surfaces connections, demonstrates full capability]

---

## Tier-Specific Conversion Triggers

### Trial → Pro ($99/mo)

| Moment | What Happens | OSQR Says |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Day 7 check-in** | Mid-trial reflection | "We're halfway through the trial. What's been most useful?" |
| **Memory demonstration** | User references past conversation | "I remember. That's one thing that changes if trial ends - I'd forget all this." |
| **Thoughtful Mode success** | Deep analysis delivered value | "That took my full thinking. Worth keeping access to." |
| **Trial ending (Day 13)** | Proactive notice | "One day left. Here's what we've built together..." |

### Lite → Pro ($19 → $99)

| Moment | What Happens | OSQR Says |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Document limit hit (5)** | 6th document upload attempted | "I'm at capacity. Pro holds 500 documents - worth it if you're building a real knowledge base." |
| **Query limit hit (10/day)** | Complex day, needs more | "I've used my deep thinking for today. Pro gets 100 queries. Back at full capacity tomorrow, or upgrade now." |
| **Thoughtful Mode requested** | Lite doesn't have it | "That needs Thoughtful Mode - I'd use Claude AND GPT-4o together. That's Pro. Want to try it?" |
| **Pattern recognition** | Multiple sessions, clear value | "You're using me consistently. Might be time to unlock the full toolkit." |

### Pro → Master ($99 → $249)

| Moment | What Happens | OSQR Says |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Council Mode requested** | Complex decision needs debate | "This deserves Council Mode - I'd have three models argue it out. That's Master tier." |
| **Document limit approached (500)** | Building serious vault | "You're at 480 documents. Master holds 1,500 with 100GB storage." |
| **Query ceiling hit (100/day)** | Power user pattern | "You're hitting my daily limit regularly. Master gets 300 queries per day." |
| **Priority support needed** | Urgent request | "I can help, but Master gets priority processing. Matters if speed is critical." |

---

## The Smart Throttle (Lite Tier)

When Lite users exhaust their daily budget, OSQR doesn't hard-cut - it gracefully degrades:

**Behind the scenes:**
- Morning: User gets premium models (Claude Sonnet / GPT-4o)
- After budget: Falls back to lightweight models (Groq / Gemini Flash)
- User barely notices quality drop for simple Q&A
- Complex requests get the "tomorrow" soft gate

**OSQR says:**
> "I've used my deep thinking for today. I can still chat and help with quick stuff, but for another full analysis, check back tomorrow - or upgrade and I'll go deeper right now."

**Why this works:**
1. Memory persists (differentiator, costs almost nothing)
2. Daily refresh creates habit, not resentment
3. Transparent framing is honest, not manipulative
4. Multi-model router makes this technically seamless

---

## OSQR's Upgrade Voice

### Tone Guidelines
- Honest, not salesy
- Helpful, not pushy
- Confident in value, not desperate for sale
- Companion suggesting, not vendor selling

### Good Phrasings

| Situation | What OSQR Says |
|-----------|----------------|
| Feature gate | "That needs Council Mode. Want me to try without it, or is this worth Master?" |
| Limit hit | "I've hit my daily limit. Pro unlocks 10x more - or I reset tomorrow." |
| Value delivered | "That analysis took everything I had. Worth keeping access to." |
| Trial ending | "We've built something here. $99/month to keep it going." |
| Post-upgrade | "Good call. Here's what I couldn't show you before..." |

### Bad Phrasings (Never Use)

| Type | Example | Why It's Wrong |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Salesy | "Upgrade now to unlock!" | Pressure, not partnership |
| Desperate | "Don't miss out on Pro!" | Scarcity manipulation |
| Dishonest | "Limited time pricing!" | False urgency |
| Preachy | "You really should upgrade for best results." | Condescending |
| Guilt | "I could help more if you upgraded..." | Manipulative |

### When NOT to Mention Upgrade
- First session (focus on value)
- When user is frustrated (don't pile on)
- Mid-critical-task (wait for natural pause)
- After user just declined (respect the no)

### Key Presentation Principles

1. **Show current state** - "Lite has 5" makes it concrete
2. **Lead with value** - What they get, not what they're missing
3. **Founder pricing visible** - Legitimate urgency
4. **Easy to decline** - "Stay on Lite/Pro" is a real option
5. **No fake urgency** - No countdowns or "act now"

---

## Founder Pricing Strategy

**What it is:** Users who sign up during founder period lock in their rate forever, even as prices increase.

**Why it works:**
- Creates legitimate urgency (not artificial scarcity)
- Rewards early adopters
- Builds loyalty ("I got in early")
- Provides price increase flexibility later

**How OSQR mentions it:**

> "Quick note - you're on founder pricing. $99/month locks in forever, even when it goes to $149. Just so you know."

**Rules:**
- Only mention once per user
- Never as pressure tactic
- State factually, don't push
- Honor it forever (this is a promise)

---

## Handling Objections

### "It's too expensive"

> "I get it. Here's the math: you've used me [X] times this week. That's [$/use]. Worth it for what you're getting?"

### "I want to think about it"

> "Take your time. Lite isn't going anywhere, and your memory persists either way."

### "I'm not using it enough yet"

> "Fair. Stay on Lite until you're hitting limits. You'll know when it's time."

### "Can I try Pro/Master first?"

> "That's what the trial is for. Want 14 days of Pro to see if it fits?"

### "I don't need unlimited"

> "You might be right. Lite works until it doesn't. Upgrade's there when you want it."

### "Will you remember me if I stay on Lite?"

> "Yes. Memory persists across all tiers. You just get fewer queries and documents on Lite."

---

## Post-Conversion Experience

### Immediate After Upgrade

**OSQR says:**
> "Welcome to [Pro/Master]. Let me show you what just unlocked..."
>
> [Immediately demonstrates new capabilities with their actual data]

### First Paid Session

- Run deeper analysis on existing documents
- Show cross-document connections (if newly available)
- Demonstrate Council Mode (Master) or Thoughtful Mode (Pro)
- Make value obvious instantly

### Ongoing Paid Experience

- Never mention upgrade again (they're already there)
- Proactive about using full capability
- Occasional "Pro/Master tip" for advanced features
- Acknowledge their investment subtly

### Churn Prevention (First 30 Days)

| Day | Check | OSQR Action |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Has user returned? | If not, proactive "I found something in your documents..." |
| 7 | Feature usage | If not using tier features, demonstrate them |
| 14 | Pattern established? | If sparse usage, "Want to schedule check-ins?" |
| 30 | Renewal approaching | No mention - if value exists, they stay |

---

## Conversion Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Trial → Pro conversion | 25-40% | Primary revenue driver at launch |
| Lite → Pro conversion | 15-25% | Post-1,000 user funnel efficiency |
| Pro → Master conversion | 5-10% | Power user identification |
| Time to conversion | 7-14 days | How long to demonstrate value |
| First-month churn (Pro) | <10% | Did they actually want it? |
| First-month churn (Master) | <5% | High commitment = high retention |

### Funnel Visualization (Post-Lite Launch)

```
Lite Users (100%)
     ↓
Engaged Users - 5+ sessions (50%)
     ↓
Hit Meaningful Limit (30%)
     ↓
Saw Upgrade Mention (25%)
     ↓
Viewed Pricing (15%)
     ↓
Completed Upgrade (10-15%)
```

## Open Questions for Future Versions

1. Should trial length vary by referral source?
2. What's the right Lite → Pro conversion messaging frequency?
3. Should Pro users be able to gift trials to others?
4. How do we handle users who convert and immediately cancel?
5. When exactly does Lite launch? (Currently "post-1,000 users")
6. Should there be a Master trial, or only Pro?
7. What triggers Master-only Council Mode mentions for Pro users?
