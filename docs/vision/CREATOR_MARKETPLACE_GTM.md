# OSQR Creator Marketplace: Go-To-Market Strategy

## Target Version: V2.0+ (Full Open Marketplace at V3.0)

**Status:** Strategic planning — not immediate execution
**Created:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Document the author/creator acquisition strategy for marketplace launch

---

## The Core Insight

Every business, self-help, and educational author has:
- Frameworks already documented
- Content already created
- An audience already built
- **No way to make their book *active* in readers' lives**

Their book gets read once. Maybe referenced occasionally. Then sits on a shelf.

**A plugin makes the book persistent.**

---

## The Problem Authors Have

Authors sell books. Books are:
- One-time revenue (unless they keep writing)
- Passive after purchase (reader may or may not apply the ideas)
- Disconnected from reader's actual life (no feedback loop)
- Competing with every other book for attention

The author's goal is **transformation** — they want readers to actually *use* the frameworks.

But the book format can't deliver ongoing application. It delivers information, then goes silent.

---

## The OSQR Solution

**Turn books into plugins.**

The reader finishes "Buy Back Your Time" → installs the Martell plugin → now every time they ask OSQR for help with their business, Martell's frameworks are actively applied.

- "Should I hire for this?" → Plugin applies the Buyback Principle
- "How do I structure my week?" → Plugin applies the Perfect Week framework
- "Is this task worth my time?" → Plugin calculates against Buyback Rate

**The book stops being a one-time read. It becomes an ongoing thinking partner.**

---

## The Pitch to Authors

### Short Version

> "Your book changed how people think — for a week. What if it could change how they think forever?"

### Full Pitch

> "You've spent years developing frameworks that transform how people [run businesses / build wealth / lead teams / raise families / etc.].
>
> Your book captures those frameworks. But here's the problem: books are passive. Readers finish, feel inspired, then go back to their old patterns. Your ideas sit on a shelf.
>
> What if your frameworks were *active*?
>
> OSQR is an AI platform where your readers can install your thinking as a plugin. Every time they ask for help, your frameworks are applied to their specific situation. Not generic AI advice — *your* methodology, applied automatically.
>
> You already wrote the content. We help you turn it into a plugin. You earn recurring revenue every month your readers use it — not just once at purchase.
>
> Your book becomes a thinking partner that never stops working."

---

## Why Authors Will Say Yes

### 1. Recurring Revenue
Books = one-time purchase ($15-30)
Plugins = monthly subscription ($5-50/month, author keeps 80%)

A reader who pays $20 for a book generates $20.
A reader who uses a plugin for 2 years generates $240-1,200.

**10-50x lifetime value.**

### 2. Deeper Reader Relationship
Currently: Author has no idea if readers apply the frameworks.
With plugin: Author can see (anonymized) what frameworks get used, what problems readers face, what's working.

**Feedback loop that improves future books and content.**

### 3. Competitive Differentiation
Most authors: "Buy my book"
Plugin authors: "Buy my book, then install my thinking into your AI"

**First movers in each category own mindshare.**

### 4. Legacy Extension
Books go out of print. Ideas get forgotten.
Plugins persist. Frameworks keep being applied.

**The author's thinking stays active longer than any book.**

### 5. Audience Expansion
The author's existing audience becomes OSQR users.
OSQR users discover other plugins.
But they also discover this author through marketplace browsing.

**New audience acquisition channel.**

---

## The Plugin Creation Process

Authors won't build plugins themselves. They'll create them through conversation with OSQR.

### Step 1: Framework Extraction
OSQR conversation that asks:
- "What are the core frameworks you teach?"
- "What's the transformation you promise readers?"
- "Walk me through how you'd help someone with [specific problem]"

**Output:** Documented frameworks with application logic

### Step 2: Diagnostic Development
OSQR conversation that asks:
- "How do you diagnose which framework someone needs?"
- "What questions do you ask a new client/reader?"
- "What signals tell you someone is at Stage 1 vs Stage 3?"

**Output:** Diagnostic triggers that match user situations to frameworks

### Step 3: Voice Capture
OSQR conversation that asks:
- "How would you say this to a client?"
- "What phrases do you use repeatedly?"
- "What's your tone when delivering tough feedback?"

**Output:** Language patterns that make the plugin sound like the author

### Step 4: Sequencing Logic
OSQR conversation that asks:
- "What do you address first with a new client?"
- "What must be true before you teach Framework X?"
- "What's the progression you take people through?"

**Output:** Sequencing rules for when to introduce what

### Step 5: Review & Refinement
Author tests the plugin on real scenarios.
Identifies gaps, wrong tone, missing frameworks.
Iterates until it feels like *them*.

**Output:** Launch-ready plugin

```

1. Author creates plugin from existing content
2. Author promotes plugin to existing audience
3. Audience becomes OSQR users
4. OSQR users discover other plugins
5. Other authors see the model working
6. More authors create plugins
7. OSQR user base grows
8. Repeat

**You don't market OSQR to users. You market to authors. Authors bring users.**

## Outreach Strategy

### The Math
- Contact 1,000 creators
- 10% respond positively (100)
- 20% of those actually create plugins (20)
- Those 20 bring their audiences

**20 plugins from 1,000 contacts is a successful marketplace launch.**

### Outreach Channels

**Direct outreach:**
- Email (if available)
- LinkedIn DM
- Twitter/X DM
- Through their team/publisher

**Warm intros:**
- Dan Martell network (Kable has access)
- Other coaching/mastermind connections
- Conference networking

**Content-based:**
- Podcast appearances explaining the model
- Blog posts / tweets about "active books"
- Case studies from early creators

### Outreach Messaging

**Subject:** Your book, but it never stops working

**Body:**
> [Name],
>
> I've built an AI platform called OSQR. I want to turn your book into something that actively helps readers apply your frameworks — not just once, but every time they face a decision.
>
> Imagine a reader finishes [Book Title], then installs your plugin. Now every time they ask their AI for help, your thinking is in the room. Your frameworks applied to their specific situation.
>
> You keep 80% of subscription revenue. Your content already exists — we turn it into a plugin through a guided conversation.
>
> [Early creator / Case study] just launched and [result].
>
> Worth a conversation?
>
> — Kable

## Economics

### Author Revenue Model

**Plugin pricing:** $9-49/month (author sets price)
**Revenue split:** 80% author / 20% OSQR

**Example:**
- 1,000 readers install plugin at $19/month
- Monthly revenue: $19,000
- Author keeps: $15,200/month
- Annual author revenue: $182,400

**Compare to book:**
- 10,000 books sold at $20
- Author royalty ~15% = $3/book
- Total author revenue: $30,000

**Plugin revenue can exceed book revenue with 1/10th the audience if retention is strong.**

### OSQR Revenue Model

**From plugins:**
- 20% of all plugin revenue
- At scale: Thousands of plugins × thousands of users × $10-50/month

**From subscriptions:**
- Users pay OSQR subscription ($99-249/month)
- Plugin revenue is additional

**The plugin marketplace makes OSQR subscription more valuable, which increases subscription revenue.**

---

## Competitive Moat

Once authors are on OSQR:
- Their content is indexed and structured for OSQR
- Their audience is using OSQR
- They're earning recurring revenue
- Switching means rebuilding everything

**High switching costs for creators = defensible marketplace.**

Additionally:
- Network effects (more plugins = more users = more plugins)
- Data moat (behavioral data on what frameworks work)
- Creator relationships (first mover in author partnerships)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Authors don't see the value
**Mitigation:** Lead with revenue math. Show case studies. Offer done-for-you plugin creation.

### Risk: Plugins are low quality
**Mitigation:** Quality standards, curation, ratings. Private beta to establish quality bar.

### Risk: Big authors won't work with unknown platform
**Mitigation:** Start with mid-tier. Build case studies. Leverage warm intros. Let success create gravity.

### Risk: Users don't pay for plugins
**Mitigation:** Free trials. Prove value before payment. Start with highest-value categories (business).

### Risk: Authors build on competitor platform
**Mitigation:** Move fast. Lock in relationships early. Make OSQR the best platform for this use case.

---

## Key Metrics

**Creator side:**
- Creators contacted
- Creators onboarded
- Plugins launched
- Creator revenue generated
- Creator retention (do they keep updating/promoting?)

**User side:**
- Plugin install rate
- Plugin retention (30-day, 90-day)
- Plugin revenue per user
- Multi-plugin usage (users with 2+ plugins)

**Marketplace health:**
- Plugins per category
- Category coverage
- Quality scores
- Discovery effectiveness (do new plugins get found?)

---

## The Vision

**OSQR becomes the platform where ideas become active.**

Not just books. Any structured thinking:
- Courses
- Coaching methodologies
- Consulting frameworks
- Podcast insights
- YouTube educational content

If someone teaches *thinking*, they can turn it into a plugin.

**The world's knowledge, personalized and applied to each user's specific situation.**

That's not a feature. That's a category.

---

## Summary

**The opportunity:**
Authors have frameworks. Readers want application. Plugins bridge the gap.

**The strategy:**
Market to authors, not users. Authors bring users. Flywheel spins.

**The timing:**
V2.0+ (Private beta starts V2.0, full open marketplace at V3.0)

**The outcome:**
OSQR becomes the platform where the world's best thinking is actively applied, not passively consumed.
