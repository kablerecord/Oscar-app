## 1. Core Thesis

**The OSQR Marketplace is not a revenue feature.**
It is a **distribution and retention engine**.

Direct revenue is measurable.
Indirect value (users, habits, dominance) is the real prize.

> OSQR grows by empowering people users already trust.

---

## 2. What a Creator Plugin IS

A Creator Plugin is **not**:
- Content
- A course
- A prompt pack
- A standalone AI

A Creator Plugin **is**:

> A **Judgment Profile** that temporarily changes how OSQR thinks.

When active, a plugin measurably alters:
- What OSQR notices
- What it asks
- How hard it pushes back
- How many options it allows
- When it commits

**Users are not buying information. They are borrowing expert judgment.**

---

## 3. Plugin Effect Dimensions (Quality Gate)

Every marketplace-grade plugin must meaningfully change **at least 3 of these 6 dimensions**:

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Attention** | What OSQR notices / ignores / flags |
| **Questions** | What OSQR asks and in what order |
| **Judgment** | Opinion strength, pushback, decisiveness |
| **Option Space** | How aggressively choices are pruned |
| **Standards** | What is unacceptable; restart rules |
| **Outcome Bias** | Speed vs polish, learning vs execution, art vs performance |

### The 3-of-6 Rule

> If a plugin does not reduce ambiguity, it is not worth paying for.

Plugins that only change tone or add information without altering decision-making behavior **do not qualify** for marketplace listing.

This is the quality gate that separates "prompt packs" from real judgment profiles.

---

## 4. Internal Judgment Variables

These are the underlying variables that plugins influence. Creators never see these as knobs — OSQR infers them conversationally.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Priority hierarchy** | What matters most in this domain |
| **Decision aggressiveness** | How quickly to commit |
| **Option pruning threshold** | How many alternatives to keep alive |
| **Error sensitivity** | What mistakes are unacceptable |
| **Context weighting** | Which inputs matter most |
| **Completion threshold** | When something is "done enough" |
| **Teaching vs command bias** | Explain or just direct |

These variables are **domain-agnostic** and scale from coaches to creatives to operators.

---

## 5. Plugin Capability Scope

### v1 Included

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Perspective injection | Plugin's worldview influences responses |
| Question funnels | Creator-specific diagnostic sequences |
| Non-negotiable rules | Hard stops and restart conditions |
| Guided workflows | Decision trees and stage-gates |
| Strong pushback | Challenge and commitment extraction |

### v1 Explicitly Excluded

| Exclusion | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| System prompt access | Security, consistency |
| Arbitrary code execution | Safety |
| External data export | Privacy |
| Tool execution without permission | User agency |

These may be unlocked in later versions with appropriate safeguards.

---

## 6. Creator Plugin Creation Flow

### Principle: Conversation-First

No portals. No forms. No paperwork.

Plugin creation happens via **guided conversation with OSQR**.

OSQR:
- Uses prior account knowledge
- Asks judgment-extracting questions
- Pushes for examples and edge cases
- Detects vague opinion vs repeatable expertise
- Confirms inferred constraints in plain language

**Creators feel interviewed into existence, not configured.**

### The Entry Question

> "What decision do people come to you for?"

OSQR reverse-engineers domain, lens, and workflows from there.

### Example Interview Flow

```
OSQR: "What decision do people come to you for?"

Creator: "Pricing their services"

OSQR: "When someone prices wrong, what's usually the mistake?"

Creator: "They anchor to competitor prices instead of value delivered"

OSQR: "So if I see someone researching competitor pricing first,
       that's a flag. What should I do?"

Creator: "Stop them. Ask what transformation they're selling first."

OSQR: "Got it. When is someone ready to pick a price?"

Creator: "When they can articulate the before/after clearly"

OSQR: "So completion threshold = clear before/after articulation.
       What's a non-negotiable in your approach?"

Creator: "Never price hourly. Ever."

OSQR: "Hard rule: reject hourly framing, redirect to value.
       Let me confirm what I've learned..."
```

This conversation generates the plugin. No forms required.

## 7. Creator Gatekeeping

### Philosophy: Earned Access, Not Credentials

Gatekeeping is based on **signal + relationship**, not credentials or follower counts.

### Creator Tiers

| Tier | Access | Requirements |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Creator Mode** | Private plugins only, testing + invite sharing | Any account |
| **Marketplace Candidate** | Can submit for listing | 60-90 day account age, consistent usage, successful interview |
| **Verified Creator** | Premium placement, featured spots | Retention signals, low abuse/refund, proven results |

### Why This Works

- Prevents fake experts flooding marketplace
- Rewards genuine OSQR users
- Creates progression incentive
- Maintains quality without credential gatekeeping

---

## 8. Marketplace Launch Strategy

### Founding Creator Strategy

The marketplace must launch **with signal, not emptiness**.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Identify** | OSQR identifies qualified users internally |
| **Invite** | Direct personal invitations |
| **Incentivize** | First-mover advantage + category ownership |
| **Lock** | Founding economics locked permanently |

### High-Profile Creators (Martell, Golden, etc.)

**Positioning:**

> "Your judgment, embedded inside a superior intelligence."

**Value prop:**
- Low friction (conversation only, no tech work)
- Locked founding economics (20% forever)
- Category ownership (first pricing expert, first fitness coach, etc.)
- Scale without additional time

### Launch Sequence

1. **Founder Plugin** (Kable) ships first as reference
2. **5-10 Founding Creators** invited and onboarded
3. **Category coverage** ensured (business, health, creativity, productivity)
4. **Public marketplace** opens with established quality signal

---

## 9. Monetization Philosophy

### Core Belief

> OSQR should optimize for gravity, not extraction.

Creators must make **real money** so they promote aggressively.

### Economics (Locked)

| Party | Share |
|-------|-------|
| Creator | **80%** |
| OSQR | **20%** |

This is publicly stated and locked for founding creators.

### Why 20% (Not Higher)

- **30%+ (App Store model):** Creates resentment, slower adoption
- **20%:** Appreciated, aggressive creator promotion, compounds growth
- **10-15%:** Leaves money on table unnecessarily

### Strategic Priority

Marketplace revenue is **secondary** to:
- User acquisition
- Retention
- Habit formation

OSQR monetizes primarily via:
- Pro / Max subscriptions
- Increased LTV from plugin users
- Enterprise licensing (later)

---

## 10. Creator Promotion Mechanics

### Philosophy: Infrastructure, Not Affiliate

Creators should promote OSQR **as infrastructure**, not an affiliate link.

### Natural Promotion Patterns

What creators will say:
- "This is how I think now."
- "I use this instead of explaining the same thing 100 times."
- "If you want my judgment, it's in OSQR."

### Built-In Promotion Levers

| Lever | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Creator-branded plugin pages | Their brand, their audience |
| Shareable decision outputs | "Here's what [Creator] would say" |
| "Powered by OSQR" trust signal | Platform credibility |
| Founding creator badge | Status signaling |
| Earnings dashboard | Visible success |

### Incentive Alignment

Creators win when their audience upgrades.
OSQR wins when creators win.
Users win when they get expert judgment on demand.

Everyone is aligned.

## 11. Growth Expectations

### Order-of-Magnitude Projections

| Year | Users | Driver |
|------|-------|--------|
| Year 1 | 100k–250k | Several strong creators activating audiences |
| Year 2 | 500k–1.2M | Creator network effects + word of mouth |
| Year 3 | 2–5M+ | Category leadership + enterprise expansion |

### Growth Pattern

Growth occurs in **steps**, driven by creator activation events.

Each major creator brings:
- Their audience (direct)
- Credibility signal (indirect)
- Content about OSQR (distribution)
- Other creators watching (network)

---

## 12. Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Plugins Feel Indistinguishable from Base OSQR

**Symptom:** Users don't perceive value difference
**Mitigation:** 3-of-6 effect dimension requirement
**Detection:** Low retention, high refund rates

### Risk 2: Fake Experts Flood Marketplace

**Symptom:** Low-quality plugins, user disappointment
**Mitigation:** Conversational extraction + earned access tiers
**Detection:** Interview failure rate, quality signals

### Risk 3: Creators Don't Promote

**Symptom:** Marketplace exists but doesn't grow
**Mitigation:** 20% take rate + visible earnings + success stories
**Detection:** Creator revenue, social mentions

### Risk 4: Competitors Copy Concept

**Symptom:** Similar offerings appear
**Mitigation:** Creator lock-in + emotional switching costs + head start
**Detection:** Market monitoring

### Risk 5: Over-Engineering Early

**Symptom:** v1 never ships, complexity blocks progress
**Mitigation:** v1 excludes code execution, complex permissions
**Detection:** Engineering timeline, scope creep

---

## 13. Plugin Council Mode (v1.5+)

> **Status:** Future capability. NOT v1.

### Core Principle

> OSQR does not average expert opinions — it preserves them, then reasons about the differences.

This allows users to invoke **multiple Creator Plugins** for comparison and synthesis.

### Default Rule (Non-Negotiable)

**Only ONE plugin constrains OSQR at a time by default.**

This preserves:
- Decisiveness
- Trust
- Speed
- Strong judgment

Judgment requires commitment. Experts disagree. One voice at a time.

### Explicit Invocation Only

Multi-plugin reasoning is **never automatic**.

Users must explicitly request it:
- "Compare how Martell and Hormozi would approach this."
- "Where do these two frameworks disagree?"
- "Give me the irreconcilable differences and your recommendation."

OSQR signals clearly:
> "You are invoking multiple expert lenses. Disagreement is expected."

### How It Works

1. Each plugin reasons independently under its own constraints
2. Each produces:
   - A recommendation
   - Rationale
   - Non-negotiable rules triggered
3. OSQR Core then:
   - Identifies agreements
   - Surfaces disagreements
   - Explains *why* they differ
   - Proposes synthesis **or forces a choice**

**OSQR remains the final arbiter.**

### Strategic Value

Enables:
- Premium OSQR tiers (Max / Enterprise)
- Creator collaboration bundles
- "Martell vs Hormozi" comparisons
- Enterprise decision review workflows

Increases:
- Perceived intelligence
- Defensibility
- Switching costs

### Versioning

- **v1:** Single active plugin only
- **v1.5 / v2:** Plugin Council Mode

---

## 14. Platform Constitution

> OSQR owns the reasoning engine.
> Creators own the constraints imposed on it.
> Users own the decisions they make with it.

This three-way separation ensures:
- OSQR can improve without breaking plugins
- Creators have real ownership of their IP
- Users maintain full agency

---
