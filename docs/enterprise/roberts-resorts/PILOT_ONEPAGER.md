# OSQR Edge Pilot
## Roberts Resorts | Executive Intelligence Layer

---

## What This Is

A 30-day pilot to test whether OSQR can serve as Roberts Resorts' private knowledge brain — giving your executive team instant access to your institutional knowledge without searching through files or calling someone.

---

## Who It's For

| Role | Why They'd Use It |
|------|-------------------|
| **Scott Roberts (CEO)** | Strategic analysis, acquisition evaluation, board prep |
| **Erik Gothberg (VP Ops)** | SOP queries, cross-property pattern recognition |
| **Bob Pence (SVP Acquisitions)** | Due diligence acceleration, deal comparison |
| **2-3 Additional Execs** | As appropriate to your team |

**Total pilot users:** 3-6 executives

---

## What We Need From You

### Documents (Start with 5-10)

Upload materials you actually reference or wish were more accessible:

- [ ] Acquisition checklist or due diligence template
- [ ] Operations SOPs (community management, maintenance, etc.)
- [ ] Training materials for key roles
- [ ] Board decks or strategic plans
- [ ] Any "playbook" documents

**More is better, but start with what's easy.** We can add throughout the pilot.

### Time

| Activity | Time Required |
|----------|---------------|
| Initial setup call | 30 minutes (one-time) |
| Weekly check-in | 15 minutes |
| Actual usage | As natural — no minimum |

---

## What OSQR Does

| Capability | Example Use |
|------------|-------------|
| **Instant document Q&A** | "What's our policy on late rent payment?" |
| **Multi-document synthesis** | "Compare how we handle maintenance at Gold Canyon vs. Rayford Crossing" |
| **Gap identification** | "What's missing from this acquisition checklist?" |
| **Content generation** | "Write a training summary for new community managers based on our SOPs" |
| **Strategic analysis** | "If we add 3 properties next quarter, where are we most exposed?" |

---

## Pilot Timeline

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Week 1** | Setup: Upload initial documents, test basic queries |
| **Week 2** | Exploration: Expand document set, try deeper questions |
| **Week 3** | Integration: Apply to real work (acquisition, ops decision, etc.) |
| **Week 4** | Evaluation: Assess value, discuss next steps |

---

## Success Criteria

We'll know the pilot worked if:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Weekly usage** | Each pilot user queries OSQR 3+ times/week |
| **Time saved** | Users report saving 2+ hours over the month |
| **Answer quality** | 80%+ of answers rated "helpful" |
| **Expansion interest** | At least one exec asks "can we add more people?" |
| **Gut check** | Scott says "I'd miss this if it went away" |

---

## What This Costs

**Pilot: Free**

This isn't a trial with a ticking clock. It's a genuine test to see if OSQR fits how you work.

**If we go enterprise:** We'd discuss after the pilot based on scope. Ballpark for org-wide: less than one analyst salary. Founding users lock in rates permanently.

---

## Security & Privacy

| Concern | How We Handle It |
|---------|------------------|
| **Data ownership** | You own everything. Delete anytime. |
| **Training** | Your data is never used to train models |
| **Access** | Your vault is isolated. No cross-customer access. |
| **Compliance** | SOC2 roadmap, SSO available, audit logs |

**Full security documentation available on request.**

---

## What Happens After the Pilot

### If It Works

We discuss enterprise deployment:
- Who else should have access (Ops managers? Sales team?)
- What additional documents to onboard
- Pricing based on scope
- Implementation timeline

### If It Doesn't

We part as friends. Your data is deleted. No hard feelings.

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm pilot start date:** _______________
2. **Identify pilot users:** (3-6 executives)
3. **Initial document upload:** (5-10 docs to start)
4. **Schedule setup call:** 30 minutes to orient the team
