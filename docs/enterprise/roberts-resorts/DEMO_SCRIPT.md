# Roberts Resorts Demo Script
## 20-Minute "One Question Test" Run-of-Show

---

## Demo Philosophy

**This is not a product tour.** This is Scott asking a real question and watching OSQR deliver a real answer.

Your job is to:
1. Let him drive
2. Show value, don't explain features
3. Handle imperfection gracefully
4. Leave him wanting more

---

## Pre-Demo Checklist

### Before the Call

- [ ] Confirm OSQR is working (test with sample query)
- [ ] Have his document pre-uploaded if he sent one
- [ ] If no document, have 2-3 Roberts-relevant docs ready (public materials)
- [ ] Test screen share
- [ ] Have "killer questions" ready if he doesn't know what to ask
- [ ] Review Roberts Resorts basics (properties, recent news, key initiatives)

### Tech Setup

- [ ] OSQR logged in, vault visible
- [ ] Clean browser (no embarrassing tabs)
- [ ] Notifications off
- [ ] Good audio/video
- [ ] Backup screen share option if primary fails

## The Demo Flow

### Opening (2 minutes)

**Goal:** Set expectations, remove pressure, let him know this is his exploration.

**Say:**
> "Thanks for making time. Here's how I'd suggest we use these 20 minutes:
> 
> You give me a document — something you actually care about. Could be an SOP, an acquisition deck, a training manual, whatever. I'll drop it in OSQR. Then you ask it a question you'd ask a smart analyst who's read the whole thing.
> 
> If it's useful, we'll talk about what else is possible. If it's not, we'll figure out why. No pitch either way.
> 
> What do you have for me?"

**If he didn't send a document ahead of time:**
> "No worries. I pulled together some Roberts materials from public sources — your website, some press coverage, job postings. Let me show you what OSQR already knows about your business."

---

### Upload + First Impression (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Show the vault, upload his document, let him see the process.

**Say (while sharing screen):**
> "This is the vault. Everything you upload lives here — private, secure, never used to train any model.
> 
> Let me drop your [document name] in..."

**While uploading:**
> "OSQR is reading and indexing this now. Depending on size, this takes 10-30 seconds. For a full operations library, you'd upload once and it's permanently available."

**After upload:**
> "Done. Now ask it something."

---

### His First Question (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Let him ask what he actually wants to know. Let OSQR shine.

**If he has a question ready:** Let him type or tell you to type it.

**If he's unsure what to ask, offer suggestions:**

> "Here are questions that usually land well:
> - 'What are the three biggest risks in this document?'
> - 'Summarize this in one paragraph for a board meeting.'
> - 'What questions should I be asking that I'm not?'"

**After the response appears:**
- Stay quiet. Let him read.
- Don't explain what OSQR did. Let him react.
- If he looks impressed, ask: "Useful?"
- If he looks confused, ask: "What were you hoping to see?"

---

### Go Deeper (7 minutes)

**Goal:** Show that OSQR can follow up, cross-reference, and think.

**Follow-up prompts to suggest:**

1. **If the first answer was good:**
> "Now ask a follow-up. OSQR remembers the context."

2. **If you have multiple documents loaded:**
> "Ask something that spans multiple documents. Like: 'Compare how we handle [X] at Gold Canyon vs. Rayford Crossing.'"

3. **If he seems engaged:**
> "Want to try multi-model mode? I'll have both Claude and GPT-4 answer the same question so you can see different perspectives."

**Killer Questions (If He Needs Ideas)**

These are tailored for Roberts Resorts' world:

| Question | Why It's Powerful |
|----------|-------------------|
| "If we acquired 3 more properties next quarter, what breaks first based on our current SOPs?" | Shows strategic thinking about scale |
| "What patterns do you see in our operational challenges across properties?" | Shows cross-document synthesis |
| "Write a training summary for new community managers based on this SOP." | Shows practical content generation |
| "What's missing from this acquisition checklist that we should be asking?" | Shows gap identification |
| "Summarize our competitive positioning for a board meeting." | Shows executive communication |

---

### The Vision (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Connect what he just saw to enterprise-scale value.

**Say:**
> "What you just saw was one document. Now imagine:
> 
> Every SOP from every property. Every acquisition you've ever done. Every training manual, policy document, board deck.
> 
> All of it in here. Instantly queryable. By you, by your exec team, eventually by your property managers.
> 
> That's what enterprise looks like. One source of truth that actually answers questions."

**Pause. Let him respond.**

**If he asks "How much?":**
> "For a pilot with you and a few execs, nothing. I want to prove value first. If we expand to your whole org, we'd talk pricing then — but it's a fraction of what you'd pay one analyst."

**If he asks "What's the catch?":**
> "No catch. I'm building this for operators like you. Your feedback helps me make it better. Early users get founding rates locked forever. That's the deal."

## Handling Imperfection

OSQR might not be perfect. Here's how to handle common issues:

### If the Answer Is Wrong or Weak

**Say:**
> "That's not great. Let me show you something — watch what happens when I refine the question..."

Then ask a more specific version. Show that better prompts get better answers.

**Or:**
> "This is exactly the kind of feedback I need. The model didn't catch [X]. That's a training gap I can fix. What would you have expected it to say?"

### If It's Slow

**Say:**
> "It's thinking through the full document — the deeper the question, the longer it takes. For quick lookups, it's instant. For analysis like this, give it 10-15 seconds."

### If It Hallucinates

**Say:**
> "That's not in the document. Let me show you — I can ask OSQR to cite its sources. Watch..."

Then ask: "Show me exactly where in the document you found that."

**If it can't cite:**
> "That's the model reaching beyond what's actually there. Good catch. This is why I emphasize verification for anything high-stakes."

### If He's Unimpressed

**Say:**
> "What would have made this useful? I want to understand where your bar is."

Then listen. Don't defend. His feedback is gold.

## Closing the Demo (2-3 minutes)

### If He's Interested

**Say:**
> "Sounds like this could be useful. Here's what I'd suggest:
> 
> I'll set you up with a 30-day pilot. You, and anyone else you want to include — I'd suggest 2-3 of your execs. Upload whatever's useful. Use it for real work.
> 
> We check in weekly for 15 minutes — just to see what's working, what's not. At the end of 30 days, if it's valuable, we talk about what enterprise looks like. If not, no hard feelings.
> 
> Sound good?"

### If He's Hesitant

**Say:**
> "No pressure. The access I gave you doesn't expire. Play with it when you have time. If you want to dig in together later, just text me.
> 
> In the meantime — I'd love to know what would make this a clear yes for you. That helps me build the right thing."

### If He's a Clear No

**Say:**
> "I appreciate you taking the time. If anything changes, I'm around. And regardless — hope the book was useful."
