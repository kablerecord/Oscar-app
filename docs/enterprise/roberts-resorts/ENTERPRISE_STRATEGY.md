---

## Part 2: Relationship Context

### Your History with Roberts Resorts

- Grew up working in Bob Roberts' resorts (Scott's father)
- Known Scott through that connection
- Current perception: "Concrete guy, business man, but not at his level"
- No prior business relationship beyond construction industry connection

### Relationship Assets

| Asset | How to Leverage |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Shared history** | Opens door, establishes trust baseline |
| **Understanding of their world** | Speak their language, not tech language |
| **Fourth Generation Formula** | Perfect philosophical alignment with family business values |
| **Genuine care for Scott's success** | Comes through in communication - not a pitch, a gift |

### Perception Shift Required

**From:** "Kable is a concrete guy who built some software"
**To:** "Kable is a builder who understands our world and created something that gives us an edge"

This shift happens through:
1. Leading with the book (establishes you as a thinker, not just a tradesman)
2. OSQR demonstrating immediate value (proves the tool)
3. Your understanding of their specific challenges (shows you get it)

---

## Part 3: Value Proposition Mapping

### Roberts Resorts Pain Points → OSQR Solutions

| Their Challenge | Evidence | OSQR Solution | Value Created |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Institutional knowledge loss** | 350 employees across 30 properties, high turnover in hospitality | PKV becomes searchable corporate brain | New hires productive faster, policies consistent |
| **Inconsistent training** | Multiple states, varying regulations, scattered SOPs | Upload all training docs, query naturally | Every manager answers questions the same way |
| **Acquisition due diligence** | Aggressive expansion strategy, underwriting $3B+ in deals | OSQR analyzes docs, surfaces patterns | Faster, more thorough deal evaluation |
| **Cross-property insights** | 30 communities generate massive data, patterns hidden | Multi-document analysis across properties | "What's working at Gold Canyon that Rayford Crossing should copy?" |
| **Executive time drain** | Small corporate team, Scott still hands-on | OSQR handles analysis, summarization | Scott focuses on vision, not document review |
| **Guest/resident service** | LiveChat exists but likely not AI-powered | OSQR-powered chatbot with company knowledge | 24/7 accurate answers, reduced call volume |

### Department-Specific Value Propositions

#### For Scott Roberts (CEO)
> "Upload your expansion deck, your competitor analysis, your board materials. Ask OSQR what you'd ask a brilliant analyst who knows your entire business. Get answers in seconds that would take your team days."

#### For Erik Gothberg (VP Operations)
> "Every community manager asks the same questions. OSQR answers them instantly, correctly, every time. Your policies become searchable. Your best practices become transferable. Your phone stops ringing with questions that have documented answers."

#### For Bob Pence (SVP Acquisitions)
> "Drop in a 200-page property package. Ask OSQR to identify red flags, compare to your last 5 acquisitions, flag what's missing. Due diligence that took a week now takes an afternoon."

#### For Julie Saffell (CMO)
> "OSQR writes marketing copy in your brand voice. It analyzes your reviews and tells you what guests actually care about. It drafts responses, generates content ideas, maintains consistency across 30 properties."

#### For Ernesto Iglesias (EVP Sales)
> "Your sales team asks OSQR about community features, pricing history, competitor comparisons. They get answers that used to require calling corporate. Every rep becomes as knowledgeable as your best rep."

## Part 4: Competitive Positioning

### Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

| Factor | ChatGPT | OSQR |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Company Knowledge** | Must re-upload each session | Persistent vault, always available |
| **Multi-Model** | GPT-4 only | GPT-4 + Claude + future models |
| **Enterprise Security** | Available but generic | Built for private business data |
| **Deliberation** | Single perspective | Council mode for complex decisions |
| **Context Window** | 32K tokens | Unlimited via vault + Claude's 100K |
| **Customization** | Limited | Personality sliders, trained on your patterns |

**One-liner for Scott:**
> "ChatGPT is a smart stranger. OSQR is a brilliant analyst who's read every document your company has ever produced and remembers every conversation you've had."

### Why Not Claude Directly?

| Factor | Claude Direct | OSQR |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **Persistence** | None - context per session | Full vault with memory |
| **Integration** | API only, requires dev work | Ready to use, no code |
| **Multi-Model** | Claude only | Claude + GPT-4 + others |
| **Enterprise Features** | Via partners only | Built-in |

### Why Not Hire More Analysts?

| Factor | Human Analysts | OSQR |
|--------|----------------|------|
| **Availability** | Business hours, vacation, turnover | 24/7, never leaves |
| **Speed** | Days for complex analysis | Seconds to minutes |
| **Cost** | $60-100K+ per analyst | Fraction of one salary |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Walks out the door | Permanent, grows over time |
| **Scalability** | Linear (hire more) | Infinite (same cost) |

---

## Part 4B: Default Wedge Selection

**Default wedge:** Executive Pilot (Scott + 2-3 execs)

**Why this wedge:**
- Scott's personal adoption creates top-down pull
- No integration required (pure web app)
- His usage validates value before expanding
- Executives facing real decisions = real value demonstration

**Expansion path:** Ops SOP Brain for property managers
- After executive validation, expand to operations team
- Upload all SOPs, training materials, policy docs
- Property managers query instead of calling corporate
- Measurable impact: reduced "knowledge calls" to HQ

**Alternative wedges (if Executive Pilot isn't right fit):**

| Wedge | When to Use | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Acquisition Pilot** | Bob Pence enthusiastic, active deals in pipeline | Limited users, narrow use case |
| **Ops Pilot** | Erik Gothberg champions, executive buy-in secured | Larger rollout, more support needed |
| **Marketing Pilot** | Julie Saffell champions, content creation pain acute | Smaller impact, harder to expand |

---

## Part 5: Entry Strategy

### The Approach Philosophy

**Don't pitch. Give.**

You're not selling Scott on OSQR. You're giving him something you built because you genuinely think it'll help him. The sale happens when he experiences value, not when you explain it.

### Phase 1: The Gift (Week 1)

**Action:** Send Scott two things with no ask attached.

1. **Fourth Generation Formula book** - Personal note about his family business, his kids, the legacy he's building
2. **OSQR founding access** - Simple note: "I built this. Thought of you. No pressure."

**The Message (Text or Email):**

```
Scott —

Two things I wanted to get in your hands.

First, a book I wrote for my kids. It's about building things that transfer — businesses, values, the stuff that actually lasts. Given what you're carrying with Roberts Resorts and your own family, I think you'll connect with it.

Second, something I've been building called OSQR. Think of it as an operating system for your brain — you drop in your documents, your playbooks, your knowledge, and it becomes a private intelligence layer you can query anytime.

I'm keeping it tight right now. Would rather have 10 real operators than 1,000 people who just want to "try AI." You came to mind immediately.

No pitch. No call needed. Just wanted you to have both.

If you ever want to dig in together, I'm around.

— Kable
```

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with the book (establishes philosophical credibility)
- OSQR is framed as exclusive, not sales-y
- No ask = no pressure = higher likelihood of genuine engagement
- "You came to mind immediately" = respect, not flattery

### Phase 2: The Spark (Week 2-3)

**Trigger:** Wait for his response. If no response after 2 weeks, light follow-up.

**If He Engages with the Book:**
```
Glad it landed. That piece on transfer vs. inheritance really came from watching families like yours — the ones that get it right.

If you ever want to test OSQR with something real, send me one document you wish you could just "ask questions to" and I'll show you how it works in 10 minutes.
```

**If He Engages with OSQR:**
```
Nice. What'd you throw at it first?

If you want, send me a document that matters — operations playbook, acquisition checklist, whatever. I'll load it and show you what becomes possible when OSQR actually knows your business.
```

**If No Response (After 2 Weeks):**
```
Hey Scott — no pressure on the OSQR thing. Just wanted to make sure the book got there. Let me know if you want a quick walkthrough sometime.
```

### Phase 3: The Demo (When He's Ready)

**Format:** 20-30 minute video call OR in-person if geography allows

**Demo Structure:**

1. **Context (2 min):** "What's one thing you wish you could just ask and get an instant, accurate answer on?"

2. **Live Upload (3 min):** Take whatever document he provides. Upload it to OSQR. Let him watch.

3. **First Question (5 min):** Have him ask his question. Show the response. Let him react.

4. **Go Deeper (10 min):** Follow-up questions based on his interest. Show multi-model mode if he's curious.

5. **The Vision (5 min):** "Now imagine every SOP, every training manual, every acquisition you've ever done, every board deck... all in here. Instantly queryable. That's what enterprise looks like."

6. **Next Steps (5 min):** If interested, discuss pilot scope. If not, leave gracefully.

**Key Demo Principles:**
- Let him drive. His questions, his documents, his pace.
- Don't over-explain features. Show value, let him ask.
- If something doesn't work perfectly, own it: "We're still in founding stage. That's exactly the feedback I need."

### Phase 4: The Pilot (Month 1-2)

**Pilot Scope Options:**

| Option | Scope | Duration | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Executive Pilot** | Scott + 2-3 execs, 10-20 docs | 30 days | "I use this daily" |
| **Department Pilot** | Operations team, all SOPs | 60 days | Reduced "call corporate" volume |
| **Acquisition Pilot** | Bob Pence, 3 active deals | 60 days | Faster due diligence, catches missed items |

**Recommended:** Start with Executive Pilot. Scott's personal usage creates top-down pull.

**Pilot Agreement:**
- Free access for pilot period
- Weekly 15-min check-in calls
- Honest feedback expected
- No obligation to continue

### Phase 5: The Enterprise Deal (Month 2-3)

**Trigger:** Pilot demonstrates clear value, users express "can't go back"

**Enterprise Package for Roberts Resorts:**

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Users** | Unlimited within organization |
| **Documents** | Unlimited storage |
| **Models** | Full multi-model access (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) |
| **Support** | Dedicated success manager |
| **Onboarding** | 2-week structured rollout with training |
| **Custom Integration** | API access if needed for their systems |

**Pricing Approach:**
- Don't lead with price during pilot
- When ready, frame as "fraction of one analyst hire"
- Anchor against value created, not features delivered
- Offer annual commitment for best rate

**Proposed Pricing Tiers (For Roberts-scale enterprise):**

| Tier | Scope | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Executive** | C-suite only (5-10 users) | $500-1,000/mo | Entry point |
| **Department** | One department (20-50 users) | $2,000-4,000/mo | Common expansion |
| **Enterprise** | Org-wide (unlimited) | $8,000-15,000/mo | Full deployment |

*Pricing is variable based on usage, features, and relationship. Roberts would likely start Executive, expand to Enterprise.*

## Part 6: Objection Handling

### "We're Not Really an AI Company"

**Response:**
> "Neither am I. I'm a builder. OSQR isn't about being an 'AI company' — it's about your managers having answers without calling corporate, your expansion playbooks being reusable, your institutional knowledge not walking out the door. The AI is invisible. The results aren't."

### "We'd Need IT to Evaluate This"

**Response:**
> "Totally fair. For the pilot, there's nothing to integrate — it's just a secure web app. Your team uploads docs, asks questions. If we go enterprise, we can loop in IT for any deeper integration. But the pilot is zero-lift for them."

### "What About Security?"

**Response:**
> "Your data stays yours. We don't train on it, we don't share it, you can delete it anytime. Enterprise tier includes SOC2 compliance, SSO, and dedicated infrastructure if needed. Happy to get our security docs to Kevin or whoever needs to review."

### "We Don't Have Time to Learn a New Tool"

**Response:**
> "That's actually the point. OSQR works like talking to a smart person. No training needed. If your team can type a question, they can use OSQR. The 'learning curve' is about 5 minutes."

### "Can't We Just Use ChatGPT?"

**Response:**
> "You could. But you'd have to re-upload documents every session. You'd only get one model's perspective. And it wouldn't remember anything about Roberts Resorts from one conversation to the next. OSQR is ChatGPT if ChatGPT had read every document your company ever produced and never forgot a conversation."

### "We're Not Ready for This Yet"

**Response:**
> "I get it. The early adopter window isn't for everyone. Just know — a year from now, every operator your size will have something like this. The ones who start now will have a year of institutional knowledge built up. The ones who wait will be starting from zero."

### "What If It Gives Wrong Answers?"

**Response:**
> "It will sometimes. So will any analyst you hire. The difference is OSQR tells you where it got its answer — you can verify. And it learns from corrections. Over time, it gets better. But you're right to be skeptical. That's why we pilot before we commit."

## Part 7: Success Metrics

### Pilot Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Adoption** | 80%+ of pilot users active weekly | Usage analytics |
| **Query Volume** | 50+ meaningful queries per week | Query logs |
| **Time Savings** | Users report 2+ hours/week saved | Survey |
| **Accuracy Satisfaction** | 80%+ answers rated "helpful" | Feedback tracking |
| **Expansion Interest** | At least one exec asks "can we add more people?" | Conversation |

### Enterprise Success Criteria (Post-Deal)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Monthly Active Users** | 60%+ of licensed users | Usage analytics |
| **Documents Indexed** | 500+ active documents | System data |
| **Query Volume** | 1,000+ queries/month | Query logs |
| **Support Ticket Reduction** | 20%+ decrease in "knowledge questions" | Support data |
| **Executive Satisfaction** | Scott uses personally, recommends | Direct feedback |
| **Renewal Intent** | Clear intent to renew at 9-month mark | Conversation |

---

## Part 8: Relationship Management

### Communication Cadence

| Phase | Frequency | Format | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Pre-Pilot** | As needed | Text/Email | Relationship, no pressure |
| **Pilot** | Weekly | 15-min call | Check-in, feedback, troubleshoot |
| **Post-Pilot/Decision** | As needed | Call | Discuss path forward |
| **Enterprise (Active)** | Bi-weekly | Call | Success check, roadmap input |
| **Enterprise (Stable)** | Monthly | Call/Email | Relationship maintenance |

### Escalation Path

If issues arise during pilot or enterprise:
1. First response within 4 hours
2. Resolution path within 24 hours
3. Kable personally involved for anything Scott raises
4. No hiding behind support tickets — relationship business

### Referral Potential

Roberts Resorts success unlocks:
- Other manufactured housing operators (MHI network)
- RV resort industry connections
- Scott's personal network of operators
- Industry press (MHInsider, RV Business)

**Potential Referral Ask (Post-Success):**
> "Scott, you've seen what OSQR does for your operation. Know anyone else in your world who should have access while it's still early?"

---

## Part 9: Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **OSQR not ready for enterprise use** | Medium | High | Don't push pilot until core features work. Better to delay than disappoint. |
| **Scott too busy to engage** | Medium | Medium | No-pressure approach. Let him come to it. Don't force timeline. |
| **IT/security blocker** | Low | Medium | Have security docs ready. Offer dedicated infrastructure if needed. |
| **Perceived as "just AI hype"** | Medium | High | Lead with outcomes, not technology. Let experience speak. |
| **Champion leaves company** | Low | High | Build relationships with multiple stakeholders. |
| **Competitor offers similar** | Low | Medium | First-mover advantage. Relationship > feature comparison. |

---

## Part 10: Timeline

### Optimistic Scenario

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Week 1 | Send book + OSQR access |
| Week 2 | Scott engages, schedules demo |
| Week 3 | Demo call, pilot agreed |
| Week 4-7 | Pilot period (4 weeks) |
| Week 8 | Pilot review, enterprise proposal |
| Week 9 | Deal closed |

### Realistic Scenario

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Week 1 | Send book + OSQR access |
| Week 2-4 | Light engagement, Scott busy |
| Week 5 | Follow-up, spark interest |
| Week 6 | Demo call |
| Week 7-14 | Pilot period (8 weeks) |
| Week 15-16 | Enterprise discussion |
| Week 17-18 | Deal closed |

### Conservative Scenario

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Week 1 | Send book + OSQR access |
| Week 2-8 | Minimal engagement |
| Week 9 | Reconnect, offer to demo |
| Week 10-12 | Schedule finally happens |
| Week 13-20 | Extended pilot |
| Week 21-24 | Deal discussion |
| Month 6+ | Enterprise closed |

**Key Principle:** This is a relationship play, not a sales sprint. Better to close in 6 months with genuine partnership than force in 6 weeks with doubt.

---

## Part 12: Open Questions & Future Considerations

### Questions to Resolve

1. **OSQR Readiness:** Is the embedding pipeline working? Document indexing functional? This is go/no-go for enterprise.

2. **Pricing Model:** Should enterprise be seat-based, usage-based, or flat? Roberts deal will inform this.

3. **Support Capacity:** Can you personally support an enterprise client during alpha? Need honest assessment.

4. **Legal/Contracts:** Do you have enterprise service agreements ready? Security documentation? SLA terms?

5. **Onboarding Process:** What does structured onboarding look like? Training materials?

### Future Enterprise Playbook Additions

- Industry-specific value proposition templates
- Case study format (once Roberts or similar succeeds)
- Procurement navigation guide (for larger, slower enterprises)
- Partner/reseller structure (if pursuing channel sales)
- Enterprise marketing materials (one-pagers, ROI calculators)

## Appendix A: The Book + OSQR Synergy

Fourth Generation Formula and OSQR are deeply aligned. Use this:

| Book Concept | OSQR Parallel |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Transfer is taught, not caught" | OSQR captures and transfers institutional knowledge |
| "Documentation creates clarity" | OSQR makes documentation queryable and useful |
| "Productive struggle builds capability" | OSQR enables learning without spoon-feeding |
| "97% of wealth disappears by generation 4" | OSQR prevents knowledge loss that kills businesses |

**For Scott specifically:**
> "You're building something meant to transfer. OSQR is how you make sure the knowledge — not just the assets — makes it to the next generation. Your playbooks, your lessons, your judgment... it doesn't walk out the door when you do."

---

## Appendix B: Roberts Resorts Quick Reference

**Use for quick prep before any conversation:**

- **Scott's Background:** Second-generation, took over young (21) after father's death, grew from 4 to 30 properties
