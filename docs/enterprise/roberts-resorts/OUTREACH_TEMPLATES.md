# Roberts Resorts Outreach Messaging
## All Communication Templates for Scott Roberts

---

## Context

Scott Roberts is a warm contact (you grew up working in his father's resorts), but you haven't approached him as a peer in business before. These messages bridge that gap — leading with genuine value, not a pitch.

**Relationship temperature:** Warm (history) but dormant (no recent business relationship)

**Perception shift required:** "Concrete guy" → "Builder who understands our world and created something valuable"

---

## Initial Outreach Options

### Option A: Text Message (Preferred — Most Natural)

```
Scott —

Been thinking about you and the business lately. Two things I wanted to get in your hands.

First, a book I wrote for my kids about building things that transfer. Given what you're carrying with Roberts Resorts and your family, I think you'll connect with it.

Second, something I've been building called OSQR — basically an operating system for everything you know. You drop in your docs and playbooks, and it becomes a private brain you can query anytime.

Keeping it tight right now. You came to mind immediately.

No pitch. Just wanted you to have both. Sending the book to your Scottsdale office unless you want it somewhere else.

— Kable
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with genuine thought about him (not about selling)
- Book leads, OSQR follows (establishes you as a thinker first)
- "Keeping it tight" = exclusivity without hype
- "No pitch" = removes pressure
- Practical ask at end (where to send) creates natural reply opportunity

---

### Option B: Email (If Text Feels Too Casual)

**Subject:** Something for you — no ask attached

```
Scott,

I've been thinking about you and Roberts Resorts lately — watching what you've built since taking over from your dad is genuinely impressive. 30 properties, 5 states, and you've done it the right way.

I wanted to get two things in your hands.

First: a book I wrote for my kids called Fourth Generation Formula. It's about building things that actually transfer — businesses, values, the stuff that lasts beyond us. Given what you're carrying and your own family, I think you'll connect with it.

Second: something I've been building for the last year called OSQR. Think of it as a private operating system for your brain. You drop in your documents, playbooks, and institutional knowledge — and it becomes something you can query anytime. Not a chatbot. More like a brilliant analyst who's read everything your company has ever produced and never forgets.

I'm keeping access tight right now. Real operators only. You came to mind immediately.

No pitch, no call needed. Just wanted you to have both.

If you ever want to dig in together, I'm around. Otherwise, just enjoy the book.

— Kable

P.S. — Sending the book to your Scottsdale office. Let me know if you'd prefer somewhere else.
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with genuine respect for his work
- Same structure as text but with room for more context
- P.S. creates reply opportunity
- "No call needed" removes pressure but "I'm around" leaves door open

---

### Option C: Handwritten Note (With Physical Book Delivery)

*Include with the physical book:*

```
Scott —

Wrote this for my kids. Thought about you and what you're building.

Also sending you access to something I've been working on called OSQR. It's for people who build things that matter.

No pitch. Just wanted you to have it.

— Kable
```

**Why this works:**
- Handwritten = personal, not mass outreach
- Short = respects his time
- Creates curiosity without explaining everything
- He'll text/call you to ask more

---

## Follow-Up Messages

### Follow-Up #1: 7-10 Days After Initial (If No Response)

**Text:**
```
Hey Scott — just making sure the book got there. Let me know if you want a quick walkthrough of OSQR sometime. No pressure either way.
```

**Why this works:**
- Light check-in, not desperate
- Practical reason (confirm delivery)
- Repeats "no pressure" signal

---

### Follow-Up #2: 14-21 Days After Initial (If Still No Response)

**Text:**
```
Scott — hope you're good. The OSQR invite I sent doesn't expire, so it's there whenever you want it. If you ever want to test it with something real — drop me a document and I'll show you what becomes possible in 10 minutes.
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges he's busy without calling it out
- Removes any urgency ("doesn't expire")
- Specific offer (10 minutes, one document) makes it tangible
- Ball in his court

---

### Follow-Up #3: 30+ Days (Reconnection)

**Text:**
```
Hey Scott — been a minute. OSQR's evolved a lot since I first sent it. If you're ever curious, I'd love to show you where it's at. Easy 15-minute call whenever works.
```

**Why this works:**
- Fresh angle (product has improved)
- Light, not needy
- Specific time commitment (15 min)

## Response Handling

### If He Responds Positively About the Book

```
Glad it landed. That piece on transfer vs. inheritance really came from watching families like yours — the ones that get it right.

OSQR is there whenever you want to dig in. Or if you want to test it with something real, send me one document you wish you could just "ask questions to" and I'll show you how it works in 10 minutes.
```

---

### If He Responds Positively About OSQR

```
Nice. What'd you throw at it first?

If you want, send me a document that matters — operations playbook, acquisition checklist, whatever. I'll load it up and show you what becomes possible when OSQR actually knows your business.
```

---

### If He's Interested But "Too Busy Right Now"

```
Totally get it. The access doesn't expire — it's there when the timing's right.

If you ever want a 10-minute "one question" test, just text me. Otherwise I'll check back in a few weeks.
```

---

### If He Asks "What Does This Cost?"

```
Right now, nothing for you. I'm building the founding user base with real operators — people who'll actually use it and give me honest feedback.

If we get to enterprise (your whole team using it), we can talk pricing then. But the pilot is on me.
```

---

### If He Says "I'm Not Really an AI Guy"

```
Neither am I. I built this because I needed it, not because I care about AI.

The pitch isn't "AI is cool." The pitch is: your managers get answers without calling corporate, your playbooks become searchable, your institutional knowledge doesn't walk out the door when people leave.

The AI is invisible. The leverage isn't.
```

---

### If He Forwards to Someone Else (IT, CFO, etc.)

```
Happy to connect with [name]. For context: OSQR is a secure knowledge layer — your team uploads documents, then can query them naturally. No integration required for a pilot. Happy to share security docs or do a quick demo with whoever needs to vet it.
```

---

## Tone Calibration

### What Your Voice Sounds Like in These Messages

- **Confident but not cocky** — you built something real
- **Generous but not desperate** — you're giving, not asking
- **Peer but not presumptuous** — you respect his level while showing yours
- **Direct but not pushy** — clear offers, no pressure

### Words to Use

- "Built" (not "created")
- "Operators" (not "users" or "customers")
- "Playbooks" (not "documents")
- "Leverage" (not "efficiency")
- "Real" (not "innovative")

### Words to Avoid

- "AI-powered" (sounds like marketing)
- "Revolutionary" (oversold)
- "Synergy" (corporate cringe)
- "Excited" (sounds sales-y)
- "Reaching out" (sounds cold)
