# OSQR Podcast Seeding Playbook

**Status:** Launch Strategy (Founding Users Phase)
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
**Purpose:** Experience-first discovery through select podcast hosts

> **Derives from:** [OSQR_CONSTITUTION.md](../OSQR_CONSTITUTION.md) — "Reveal, Don't Perform"

---

## Core Principle

> **OSQR isn't marketed. It's discovered.**

We never trade access for airtime. We **invite trusted thinkers inside first** and only talk publicly if genuine excitement follows.

---

## Scope & Guardrails

* **Target Outreach:** 30 hosts total
* **Expected Outcomes:**
  * ~15 responses
  * ~10 active users
  * ~6–10 podcast appearances
  * ~3–5 long‑term advocates
* **Timebox:** 60–90 days total
* **Hard Stop Triggers:**
  * Founding Users cohort fills
  * Inbound demand exceeds onboarding capacity

No extensions. No creep.

---

## Ideal Host Criteria

Each target should meet **at least 2**:

* Builder / operator audience
* Thoughtful, long‑form conversations
* Host personally uses tools discussed
* Not hype‑driven or promo‑heavy
* Audience size is secondary to signal

**Avoid:**

* Prompt influencers
* Coupon/affiliate culture
* "Top 10 AI tools" content

---

## The 6‑Step Process

### Step 1 — Quiet Outreach (Access First)

**Do not mention the podcast.**

**Subject line options (rotate):**

* Private access to something I'm testing
* A quiet AI experiment you might appreciate
* I'd like your opinion on something (no pitch)

**Email #1 — Access Invitation**

```
Hey [Name],

I'm building something quietly and selectively, and your work stood out to me.

I'm not promoting this yet and I'm not asking for anything — but I'd love to give you private access to OSQR for a couple weeks and get your honest take.

It's not another AI assistant.
It's a thinking environment that sits above ChatGPT/Claude and focuses on clarity, synthesis, and decisions.

If you're open, I'll send access.
If not, no worries at all — figured I'd ask before opening it wider.

– Kable
```

---

### Step 2 — Acceptance Response

```
Perfect.

I'll send access separately.

One small ask:
Use it like you normally would for real thinking — not as a demo.
If it doesn't click, that's useful feedback too.

No expectations beyond that.

– Kable
```

---

### Step 3 — Access Rules (Sent With Code)

```
Quick note on access:

• This is early and intentionally small
• Please don't share screenshots or talk about it publicly yet
• Use it freely for your own thinking
• Access is time‑limited (30 days)

That's it.

– Kable
```

* Use **unique early‑access codes**
* Track start date + expiration

---

### Step 4 — Silence Window (10–14 Days)

Do nothing.

No nudges.
No check‑ins.
No "what do you think?" messages.

If OSQR is working, curiosity will surface naturally.

---

### Step 5 — Fit Check + Podcast Invitation

Only send if they've used OSQR.

```
Hey [Name],

Curious — has OSQR found its way into your workflow at all?

If it has, I'd be open to coming on your show and talking less about the product and more about the ideas behind it:
• Why thinking is the real bottleneck
• How AI changes decision‑making
• Why I'm intentionally keeping this small

If not, totally fine — just wanted to check in.

– Kable
```

This filters out weak fits automatically.

---

### Step 6 — Green Light Criteria

Proceed **only if** they show genuine enthusiasm:

* "I've been using it…"
* "This is interesting…"
* "I'd love to talk about this…"

At this point, the episode will be:

* Authentic
* Experience‑based
* High signal

## Early Access Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 30 days |
| Visibility | Private only |
| Screenshots | Not allowed without permission |
| Affiliates | Not offered initially |
| Renewal | Case‑by‑case only |

Affiliates are introduced later **only** for true advocates.

---

## Tracking (Simple & Manual)

For each contact, track:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name / Podcast | Who they are |
| Date contacted | When outreach sent |
| Response (Y/N) | Did they reply |
| Access granted (date) | When they got access |
| Usage signal (Y/N) | Evidence of actual use |
| Podcast invite (Y/N) | Was Step 5 sent |
| Episode date | If scheduled |

A simple spreadsheet is sufficient.

---

## Positioning Anchors (Internal)

If asked "what is OSQR?":

* "A thinking environment, not an assistant."
* "It sits above models and focuses on clarity."
* "Most people aren't limited by AI — they're limited by how they think."

Never list features unless pressed.

---

## Exit Condition

When OSQR begins spreading without outreach:

**Stop immediately.**

The goal is momentum through discovery, not saturation.

---

## Alignment with OSQR Principles

This playbook embodies several Constitution principles:

| Principle | How This Playbook Applies |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Reveal, Don't Perform** | Access first, pitch never |
| **Capabilities Over Outcomes** | Show the tool, don't prescribe how to use it |
| **The Silence Rule** | 10-14 day window with no contact |
| **Emergent Use** | Let hosts discover their own use cases |
| **Agency** | No pressure, easy exit, genuine choice |

---

## Final Reminder

> We are not chasing attention.
> We are letting the right people discover something early.

This is how durable products enter the world.
