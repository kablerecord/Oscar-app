## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) is a revolutionary multi-agent framework that democratizes AI expertise through the **Agent-as-Code paradigm**. It transforms development workflows with specialized AI agents working systematically through the entire software lifecycle.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that operate in isolation, BMAD introduces a collaborative multi-agent system where specialized agents work together systematically — mirroring real-world agile development teams but with AI efficiency and consistency.

## Core Concepts

### Agent-as-Code Paradigm

The core innovation of BMAD-METHOD. AI expertise becomes as portable as any code file. Specialized agents can be shared and reused across projects, preserving institutional knowledge even as teams change or scale.

### Agentic Planning

The **Analyst**, **PM**, and **Architect** agents collaborate to create:
- Detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Comprehensive architecture designs

This ensures every project starts with solid foundations and clear technical direction before any code is written.

### Context-Engineered Development

The **Scrum Master agent** transforms high-level plans into hyper-detailed development stories, providing developers with:
- Precise, actionable tasks
- All necessary context
- Implementation details
- Acceptance criteria

### Knowledge Democratization

Agent-as-Code means AI expertise becomes portable. Specialized agents can be shared across projects, preserving institutional knowledge even as teams change or scale.
