## Definition

> "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems."

Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can connect to:

| Connection Type | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Data sources** | Local files, databases |
| **Tools** | Search engines, calculators |
| **Workflows** | Specialized prompts |

This enables AI to access key information and perform tasks.
