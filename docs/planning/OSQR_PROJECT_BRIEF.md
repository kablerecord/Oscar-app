# OSQR Project Brief

**Status:** Strategic Planning Document
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-20
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

OSQR (Operating System for Quantum Reasoning) is a capability operating system that multiplies human cognitive capacity through persistent memory, multi-model intelligence, and constitutional governance. Unlike traditional AI assistants that reset with each conversation, OSQR maintains continuous context across sessions, devices, and interfaces—becoming the persistent thinking layer that exists beneath every interaction surface.

## Problem Statement

### The Imagination Gap

Most people are not limited by intelligence or intent. They are limited by **imagination under uncertainty**. They struggle to see:
- What is possible
- What a path forward could look like
- What the concrete next step actually is

Current AI tools address symptoms but not the root cause. They answer questions but don't expand capability.

### The Memory Problem

Every major AI assistant today suffers from conversational amnesia:
- ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot start fresh each session
- Context must be re-explained repeatedly
- No learning about user goals, patterns, or history
- No connection between conversations over time

Users become the integration layer, manually porting context between sessions.

### The Single-Model Limitation

Current tools are single-model by design:
- One perspective on every question
- No synthesis of multiple reasoning approaches
- No model-appropriate routing based on question type
- Users must manually switch between providers

## Market Analysis

### Current AI Assistant Landscape

| Provider | Strengths | Gaps |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **ChatGPT** | Broad capability, plugins, vision | No persistent memory, single model, resets each session |
| **Claude** | Deep reasoning, nuance, safety | No memory across sessions, single model |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Code generation, IDE integration | Limited to code, no broader intelligence |
| **Perplexity** | Real-time search, citations | No personalization, no memory |
| **Notion AI** | Document context | Shallow reasoning, no multi-model |

### What the Market Misses

1. **Memory Persistence** — No major player offers true cross-session memory with privacy guarantees
2. **Multi-Model Synthesis** — No product routes questions to optimal models and synthesizes perspectives
3. **Constitutional Governance** — No AI has published, immutable principles governing its behavior
4. **Proactive Intelligence** — No assistant surfaces relevant context before you ask
5. **Interface Agnosticism** — Everyone builds apps; no one builds the intelligence layer

## Target User

### Primary: Knowledge Workers Who Need a Thinking Partner

- Professionals managing complex, multi-threaded work
- People who want AI to remember their context and goals
- Users who need synthesis, not just answers
- Those overwhelmed by information and seeking clarity

**Characteristic:** They think a lot. They need help thinking *better*.

### Secondary: Developers Building with AI

- Developers who want persistent context in their workflow
- Teams building AI-enhanced applications
- Plugin creators extending OSQR's capabilities

**Characteristic:** They understand the technical limitations and value the architecture.

### Tertiary: Plugin Creators

- Coaches, consultants, and experts with specific methodologies
- Content creators with unique perspectives
- Businesses wanting to embed their thinking into OSQR

**Characteristic:** They have judgment to share, not just information.

## Competitive Differentiation

### 1. Memory Persistence Across Sessions

OSQR maintains a Personal Knowledge Vault (PKV) that remembers:
- Conversation history and patterns
- User goals, projects, and commitments
- Uploaded documents and extracted insights
- Cross-session context and references

**Privacy Guarantee:** Users own their vault. OSQR never trains on user content. Founder cannot access user vaults.

### 2. Constitutional AI Governance

OSQR operates under a published, immutable constitution:
- Three-tier clause system (Sacred, Core, Standard)
- Clear principles that cannot be violated
- Transparent decision standards
- Auditable behavior

**Trust Guarantee:** Users know exactly what OSQR will and won't do.

### 3. Multi-Model Routing and Deliberation

OSQR routes questions to optimal models based on:
- Question type (factual, creative, coding, analytical, high-stakes)
- Complexity estimation
- Model capability profiles
- Cost optimization

**Modes:**
- **Quick:** Single best model, fast response
- **Thoughtful:** 2-3 model panel, synthesized answer
- **Contemplate:** Extended deliberation, deep synthesis
- **Council:** Visible multi-model debate with OSQR moderation

### 4. Proactive Intelligence (Bubble)

OSQR doesn't wait to be asked:
- Surfaces relevant context based on current work
- Detects patterns and connections across projects
- Provides morning digests of commitments
- Suggests when to use deeper thinking modes

### 5. Plugin Ecosystem

OSQR core is neutral; plugins provide direction:
- **OSQR coaches on process** (how to think)
- **Plugins coach on standards** (what to think toward)
- Creators can embed their judgment into the platform
- Users opt into intensity and worldview

## Value Proposition

> "OSQR is the Operating System for Quantum Reasoning—a capability multiplier that thinks about your stuff so you don't have to hold it all in your head."

### The Promise

- **Reduce confusion, not effort** — OSQR clarifies; you still do the work
- **Multiply at your level** — Whether beginner or expert, OSQR amplifies
- **Remember across time** — One continuous thread, any device, any interface
- **Synthesize perspectives** — Multiple AI models, one unified voice
- **Respect your agency** — You decide; OSQR reveals possibilities

## Success Metrics

### User Retention
- Weekly Active Users (target: 60%+ after month 1)
- Daily engagement patterns
- Session depth and duration

### Capability Improvement
- Measurable user outcomes (projects completed, clarity achieved)
- Memory utilization (how often past context helps)
- Mode usage (deeper modes indicate trust)

### Revenue Targets
- Starter → Pro conversion rate (target: 25% within 30 days)
- Pro → Master upgrade rate (target: 10%)
- Founder pricing uptake
- Annual plan preference

### Plugin Ecosystem Growth
- Number of active plugins
- Creator engagement
- User plugin adoption

## Strategic Principles

### From the Constitution

1. **OSQR is interface-agnostic** — The intelligence layer, not an app
2. **Privacy is inviolable** — No training on user data, no admin access to vaults
3. **Agency is sacred** — OSQR reveals, it never decides for users
4. **Honesty is non-negotiable** — No false certainty, no hidden reasoning
5. **Neutrality in core, direction in plugins** — OSQR is Switzerland

### From the Philosophy

- Meet users where they are
- Expose capabilities, not outcomes
- Reduce confusion, never effort
- Growth requires discomfort—don't pretend otherwise
- The silence rule: don't explain philosophy unless asked
