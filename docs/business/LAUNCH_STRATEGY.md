# OSQR Launch Strategy

**Status:** Pre-Launch Planning
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-10
**Owner:** Kable Record

---

## 1. Launch Philosophy

OSQR launches as a **premium, invite-only product**. This is not a typical SaaS launch.

### Core Principles

1. **Scarcity creates value** — Limited access makes early users feel special
2. **Quality over quantity** — 50 engaged users beats 500 passive ones
3. **Control the narrative** — You decide who sees OSQR first
4. **Build the tribe before the product** — Community before scale
5. **Feedback density matters** — Fewer users = more signal per user

### The Tesla Model Applied

Just as Tesla launched with the Roadster (expensive, limited) before the Model S and Model 3:

| Phase | OSQR Equivalent | Users | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Roadster | Alpha + Beta | 30-50 | Prove the concept works |
| Model S | Founding Users | 100-150 | Build the brand, capture testimonials |
| Model 3 | Public Launch | 1,000+ | Scale with proven product |

You only get one launch. Make it intentional.

---

## 2. The 4-Tier Access System

Every tier gets progressively closer to the final product.

### Tier Overview

| Tier | Internal Name | Marketing Name | Size | Purpose |
|------|---------------|----------------|------|---------|
| 1 | Alpha | Inner Circle | 5-10 | Catch obvious bugs, test flows |
| 2 | Beta | Power Users | 10-20 | Deep feedback, competitive comparison |

```

**Examples:**
- `OSQR-A001-25` — Alpha, first code, 2025

## 6. Selection Criteria

Who gets in. Who doesn't.

### Ideal Early Access User

**Must Have (3+ of these):**

1. **Uses ChatGPT/Claude daily** — Understands the baseline
2. **Can articulate feedback** — Not just "it's good" or "it's bad"
3. **Builds things** — Founders, creators, operators
4. **Respects boundaries** — Won't leak or screenshot without permission
5. **Wants you to win** — Supportive, not competitive
6. **Time to test** — Actually has bandwidth to use it
7. **Some audience** (bonus) — Can amplify when ready

### Disqualifying Criteria (No-Go List)

**Do NOT accept:**

1. **Competitors** — Anyone working at AI companies
2. **Leakers** — History of sharing private info
3. **High-maintenance** — People who need hand-holding
4. **Investors asking early** — "Can I invest?" before using = red flag
5. **Tire-kickers** — Sign up for everything, use nothing
6. **Negative influencers** — Known for harsh public criticism
7. **No skin in game** — Not willing to pay when it launches

### Vetting Process

For Tier 3 and 4 applicants:

1. **Application form** — 5 questions max
   - What do you use AI for today?
   - What's frustrating about current AI tools?
   - What would you build/do with a better AI assistant?
   - How did you hear about OSQR?
   - Would you pay $49/mo for this? Why/why not?

2. **Quick review** — 2-minute assessment
   - Check LinkedIn/Twitter (if provided)
   - Look for builder signals
   - Gut check on fit

3. **Accept/Reject/Waitlist** — No maybes
   - Accept → Send code immediately
   - Reject → Polite "not right now" email
   - Waitlist → "We'll reach out when ready"

## 7. Onboarding Sequences

Different emails for different tiers.

### Tier 1: Alpha Onboarding

**Subject:** I need your eyes on OSQR

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

I'm building something I think could change how people think with AI.

It's called OSQR — and I need your help testing it before anyone else sees it.

Here's your access:
- Link: [app link]
- Code: OSQR-A00X-25

All I need from you:
1. Spend 10 minutes clicking around
2. Try uploading a document
3. Ask it a question

That's it. No need to be nice — I need to know what breaks.

Text me when you're done.

- Code: OSQR-B0XX-25

What OSQR is:
OSQR is a multi-model AI companion. It doesn't just answer questions — it routes your question to multiple AI models, synthesizes their perspectives, and gives you one clear answer.

Think: ChatGPT + Claude + strategic reasoning, in one interface.

What to test:
1. Upload a document to your Personal Knowledge Vault
2. Try all three modes: Quick, Thoughtful, Contemplate
3. Ask a complex question and watch the panel work
4. Compare it to your current AI workflow

I want to know:
- Where is OSQR better than ChatGPT/Claude?
- Where is it worse?
- What's missing?
- Would you pay $49/mo for this?

I'll send a feedback form in 7 days. But feel free to message me anytime.

Let's build something great.
