# OSQR Pricing Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Pricing Philosophy

OSQR is not a tool. It's a thinking partner, a development accelerator, and an intelligence layer. Pricing reflects transformation delivered, not features listed.

There is no replacement stack for OSQR. Even if someone paid for ChatGPT, Claude, Mem.ai, Notion AI, Cursor, and Otter combined, they still wouldn't have unified memory, cross-interface continuity, or methodology delivery. They'd pay more and get less. OSQR pricing reflects this reality.

## Pricing Rationale

### Replacement Stack Analysis

To approximate OSQR's capabilities, a user would need:

- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month
- Claude Pro: $20/month
- Mem.ai or Personal.ai: $15-30/month
- Notion AI: $10/month
- Cursor or Copilot: $20/month
- Otter.ai: $16/month
- Zapier or Make: $20-50/month
- Project management tool: $10-15/month
- Second brain app with sync: $10-15/month

**Total replacement stack: $140-200/month**

And even with all these tools, users still lack:
- Unified memory across tools
- Cross-interface continuity
- Methodology delivery via plugins
- Proactive insights
- "You don't need to explain" experience

**OSQR Pro at $99 delivers more value than a $200 stack that doesn't fully work.**

**OSQR Master at $249 is positioned at the top of the replacement stack cost while delivering capabilities the stack cannot match.**

---

### Why These Specific Numbers

**Lite at $19:** Entry point that covers costs with margin. Low enough to be impulse purchase. High enough to filter out non-serious users.

**Pro at $99:** Above the "tool" price range ($20-50) which signals this is something different. Below $100 psychological threshold. Approximately half the replacement stack cost.

**Master at $249:** Just under $250 threshold. Roughly matches full replacement stack cost. Leaves room for future tier above if needed.

**Future prices 50% higher:** Creates real founder pricing value. $99 locked when future is $149 is meaningful savings. Rewards early believers.

---

## Founder Pricing

### Structure

First 500 users lock in launch pricing forever.

- Pro: $99/month locked (future $149)
- Master: $249/month locked (future $349)

### Counter Display

Do not show counter at launch. Begin displaying when approaching cap.

- Show counter when 100 spots remain
- Or show counter when 50 spots remain
- Creates urgency without feeling like launch-day gimmick

### Why 500

At 70% Pro ($99) and 30% Master ($249):
- 350 Pro users at $99 = $34,650 MRR
- 150 Master users at $249 = $37,350 MRR
- **Total: $72,000 MRR / $864,000 ARR**

This is enough to:
- Validate product-market fit
- Fund first hires
- Prove the model before full-price customers
- Create genuine scarcity without limiting early traction

---

## Overage Pricing

When users hit daily limits, they have options beyond waiting or upgrading.

### Packages

**10 Contemplate Queries:** $10  
- Cost to OSQR: ~$3
- Margin: 70%

**10 Council Sessions:** $20  
- Cost to OSQR: ~$6
- Margin: 70%

### Why This Works

Users hitting limits mid-flow are in a buying mood. They want to keep working, not wait until tomorrow. $10 for 10 queries is $1 each, cheaper than coffee. Impulse territory.

The 70% margin floor protects against any outlier burning through purchased capacity.

### Overage UI

When limit is hit, present three options:
1. Wait until midnight (resets in X hours)
2. Buy 10 more ($10 instant access)
3. Upgrade to next tier ($X/month)

For users buying overages 3+ times per month, add:
4. Talk to us about Enterprise

## Referral System (Dropbox Model)

### Structure

Referrals earn permanent value, not temporary boosts.

**When referee signs up for trial:**
- Referrer gets: +50 PKV entries permanently
- Referee gets: 14-day Pro trial

**When referee converts to paid:**
- Referrer gets: +2 document slots permanently
- Referee gets: 25% off first month

**When referee upgrades to Master:**
- Referrer gets: +5 document slots permanently
- Referee gets: Nothing extra needed

### Caps

- Max +500 PKV entries from referrals (10 trial signups)
- Max +50 document slots from referrals (25 conversions or 10 Master upgrades)

### Why Permanent Rewards

Dropbox grew because both sides got permanent value. Daily query boosts are forgettable. Permanent vault expansion is worth pursuing. Users will actively work toward the cap.

Expected viral coefficient shift: 0.2-0.3 (temporary rewards) to 0.8-1.2 (permanent rewards).

---

## 90-Day Guarantee (Hormozi Model)

### Language

"Use OSQR for 90 days. If you don't make at least one decision faster than you would have alone, surface at least one insight you wouldn't have found, and save at least 5 hours of mental load, I'll refund every dollar. No questions. No hassle. You keep everything Oscar learned about you."

### Why This Works

Specific outcomes beat vague promises. "Think better" is unmeasurable. "One decision faster" is concrete.

Keeping the memory even after refund builds goodwill. They might come back later. And they'll tell people you were fair.

The 90-day window filters for commitment. Tire-kickers won't last 90 days. Real users who claim the refund were never going to be long-term customers anyway.

### Expected Impact

- Refund rate: ~7%
- Conversion rate increase: 30-50%
- Net revenue impact: Strongly positive

---

## Cost Structure

### Model Costs by Tier

**Lite ($19/month):**
- Max cost to OSQR: ~$6
- Guaranteed margin: 68%

**Pro ($99/month):**
- Max cost to OSQR: ~$30
- Guaranteed margin: 70%

**Master ($249/month):**
- Max cost to OSQR: ~$75
- Guaranteed margin: 70%

### Throttling Strategy

Rather than hard cutoffs, use graceful degradation:
- Premium models available while budget remains
- Falls back to economy models when budget depleted
- Complex requests get soft gate with options
- Midnight reset in user's local timezone

Frame throttling as stability, not punishment: "I need to pace myself to stay sharp."

## Revenue Projections

### At 500 Founder-Priced Users (Year 1 Early)

- 350 Pro at $99 = $34,650 MRR
- 150 Master at $249 = $37,350 MRR
- **Total: $72,000 MRR / $864,000 ARR**

### At 5,000 Users (Year 2)

With Lite tier launched, estimated distribution:
- 50% Lite (2,500 at $19) = $47,500 MRR
- 35% Pro (1,750 at $99) = $173,250 MRR
- 15% Master (750 at $249) = $186,750 MRR
- **Subscription Total: $407,500 MRR / $4.89M ARR**

Plus plugin marketplace revenue and overages.

### At Scale (60,000 Users)

Blended average ~$90/user:
- **$5.4M MRR / $64.8M ARR** from subscriptions alone

Plus 20% take on plugin marketplace revenue.

## Pricing Page Positioning

### What to Emphasize

Lead with what OSQR gives you:
- Persistent memory that follows you everywhere
- Context that never resets
- Insights surfaced before you ask
- All your thinking in one place

### What to Avoid

Do not put down competitors. Do not list a "replacement stack" comparison that implies alternatives exist.

One subtle acknowledgment is sufficient: "Most people try to get this by juggling five or six different tools. It doesn't work. You become the integration layer."

Let the value proposition stand alone. Users who have tried the fragmented approach will recognize the problem immediately.

## Open Questions for Future Versions

1. Should overage purchases roll over if unused? (Current: No)
2. Should Master users be able to gift Lite subscriptions?
3. When does Lite tier launch exactly? (Current: Post-1,000 users)
4. Should there be a team tier between Master and Enterprise?
5. How does plugin pricing interact with base tier pricing?
