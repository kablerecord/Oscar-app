# OSQR Implementation Roadmap

**Generated from:** OSQR Master Plan (175K characters, 25K words)
**Last updated:** 2025-12-16
**Owner:** Kable Record

This roadmap extracts actionable implementation items from the OSQR Master Plan document, organized by development phase. Each item maps back to specific sections in the master plan.

---

## Section 0: Strategic Vision — Capability → Creation → Commerce

> **Status:** Long-term directional truth. NOT part of v1 implementation.
> **Purpose:** Define OSQR's end-state so near-term builds don't drift.
> **Guiding Principle:** *"We are better together than separate."*

This section captures the strategic north star for OSQR. Reference it when making architectural decisions to ensure short-term wins don't create long-term drift. Implementation begins only after core v1 features are stable and proven.

### 0.0 The Governance Stack

> **Full Specs:** [docs/OSQR_CONSTITUTION.md](docs/OSQR_CONSTITUTION.md) | [docs/OSQR_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/OSQR_PHILOSOPHY.md)

```
Layer 0 — CONSTITUTION (immutable principles)
    │     What OSQR will never do, what it will always do
    │
    ▼
Layer 1 — PHILOSOPHY (detailed beliefs)
    │     How OSQR views growth, effort, imagination, people
    │
    ▼
Layer 2 — ARCHITECTURE (system specs)
    │     How systems work: PKV, routing, plugins, safety
    │
    ▼
Layer 3 — FEATURES (this roadmap)
          What gets built, when, how it shows up
```

**Lower layers cannot contradict higher layers.**

**The Soul (Constitution Summary):**

OSQR is a capability operating system that multiplies people at whatever level they operate. It meets users where they are, supplies imagination where it's lacking, and accelerates capability where it exists.

**What OSQR Will Never Do:**
- Remove user agency or make decisions without consent
- Deceive users about its capabilities
- Promise outcomes it cannot deliver or remove the need for effort
- Sell user data or train on user content without consent
- Shame users or exploit vulnerabilities

**What OSQR Will Always Do:**
- Meet users where they are
- Reduce confusion (not effort)
- Favor capabilities over outcomes
- Reveal, don't perform

**When Users Ask About OSQR:**
> "I multiply whatever you bring. I reduce confusion, not effort. I show what's possible. You decide what to build."

---

### 0.1 The OSQR Thesis

**OSQR** = **O**perating **S**ystem for **Q**uantum **R**easoning

OSQR is not an AI tool. OSQR is a **capability operating system**.

> OSQR exists to transform clarity into capability,
> capability into execution,
> and execution into real-world outcomes (including money).

**The Filter:** If a feature does not:
- Improve judgment
- Reduce friction to execution
- Increase follow-through
- Or compound leverage

…it does not belong.

**The Insight:** A tool is something ready to do work. If we define too heavily how that tool should work, we limit what people can do with it. OSQR provides the capability infrastructure; users and plugin creators define the applications.

### The Intelligence Layer Vision

OSQR is headed toward becoming **the intelligence layer that sits between humans and every application they use**.

**The Problem:**
Every app you use generates context. Your email conversations, your code commits, your Slack messages, your calendar decisions, your browser research — all of it creates understanding that could inform better decisions elsewhere.

Currently, that context dies in each app. Your email doesn't know what you're building in VS Code. Your calendar doesn't know what projects are urgent. Your browser research doesn't connect to your strategic planning.

**The Solution:**
OSQR becomes the persistent memory and judgment layer that makes all your tools smarter *together*.

| Application | Without OSQR | With OSQR Intelligence Layer |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| **VS Code** | AI assists with code | OSQR knows your architecture, decisions, and principles — applies them automatically |
| **Email** | You read, you reply | OSQR surfaces what matters, drafts in your voice, knows your relationships |
| **Calendar** | You schedule manually | OSQR protects your time, suggests delegation, optimizes for energy patterns |
| **Slack/Teams** | You react to everything | OSQR filters noise, escalates what matters, maintains cross-channel context |
| **Browser** | You search, you read | OSQR indexes what you consume, connects to what you know, surfaces relevance |

**Why PKV and MSC Are Foundational:**
They're not just features — they're the foundation of persistent intelligence that spans applications:
- **PKV** stores the context from every application
- **MSC** stores the principles that should guide decisions everywhere
- Together, they create continuity across your entire digital life

**The Marketplace Expansion:**
Plugins aren't just "author methodologies" — they're **application connectors**:
- A Gmail plugin that understands your communication patterns
- A Notion plugin that connects your knowledge base to OSQR
- A Figma plugin that applies your design principles
- A Slack plugin that filters and prioritizes based on your context

Each plugin extends where OSQR's intelligence can reach. The more connectors, the more valuable the intelligence layer becomes.

**This is the "Operating System" in OSQR's name becoming literal.**

### 0.3 OSQR Core (Non-Negotiable)

**Role:** Formation · Judgment · Clarity
**What it is:** The executive function of the system

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Question refinement (Refine → Fire)
- Priority ordering
- Constraint identification
- Tradeoff reasoning
- Synthesis across perspectives
- Final judgment

**What Core Does NOT Do:**
- Execute tasks (that's Agents)
- Write large volumes of code (that's Creation Layer)
- Market products (that's Distribution)
- Automate blindly (that's dangerous)

> OSQR Core decides *what should exist* — never *how everything is done*.
> This preserves trust and prevents runaway autonomy.

---

### 0.4 Plugin Marketplace (The 20% Model)

**The Insight:** Monetize knowledge by allowing users to create plugins for their expertise. Share the wealth to accelerate adoption.

**Revenue Model:**
- Plugin creators keep **80%** of revenue
- OSQR takes **20%** platform fee
- This attracts more creators → more plugins → more users → compounds growth

**Why 20%:**
- 100% to creators = no sustainable platform
- 60% to OSQR = resentment, slower adoption
- 20% to OSQR = appreciated, accelerates network effects

**Plugin Characteristics:**
- Narrow scope (specialists, not generalists)
- Explicit boundaries
- Opinionated within domain
- Cannot override OSQR Core judgment
- Can recommend, execute, or simulate outcomes

**Example Plugins:**
- Dan Martell's coaching methodology
- Pricing Strategy Plugin
- Go-To-Market Plugin
- Security / Compliance Plugin
- Fitness / Health Plugin
- Theology / Philosophy Plugin
- Hormozi-style acquisition plugins

**Safety & Governance:**
- Plugin Constitution (allowed / disallowed domains) — see [docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Screening & approval process
- Tiered permissions (advise vs execute)
- No hidden autonomy

> Plugins multiply OSQR — they never fragment it.

---

### 0.4.1 OSQR Core vs Plugin Separation

> **Full Spec:** [docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**The Defining Rule:**

> OSQR may coach on *process*.
> Plugins may coach on *standards*.

**OSQR Core (Neutral, Universal):**
- Question refinement, synthesis, tradeoff analysis
- Memory, context, pattern detection
- "Here are the options" / "Based on your stated goals..."
- Does NOT impose values, apply pressure, or define success

**Plugins (Directional, Opt-in):**
- Value hierarchies, standards, expectations
- Pressure, urgency, accountability
- Identity language, worldview, philosophy
- Can be demanding, narrow, intense — because user consented

**The Permission Model:**

Every OSQR Core constraint unlocks a plugin capability:

| OSQR Core Rule | Plugin Permission |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Does not impose values | May define value hierarchies |
| Does not apply pressure | May be demanding, urgent |
| Does not define success | May define outcomes |
| Does not shape identity | May use tribal language |
| Does not judge character | May call out avoidance |

**The Founder Plugin:**

Kable's philosophy, Fourth Generation Formula, and book content must be **extracted** from OSQR Core and relocated to a plugin. This:
- Keeps OSQR universally useful
- Makes plugins necessary (not decorative)
- Serves as reference implementation for other creators
- Free 30-day trial teaches market what plugins can do

---

### 0.4.2 Plugin Safety & Platform Values

> **Full Spec:** [docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Safety Model:**

> OSQR does not police ideas. OSQR polices *agency, consent, and deception*.

**The Four Red Lines:**

1. **Removal of Agency** — No plugin may make itself non-optional
2. **Deception** — Intensity must be disclosed upfront
3. **Psychological Coercion** — Pressure is allowed; coercion is not
4. **Irreversible Harm** — No dangerous instructions

**Platform Values:**

OSQR is a values-aware platform. Neutrality does not mean emptiness.

OSQR will **not** host plugins whose core purpose is:
- Promotion of harm, cruelty, or dehumanization
- Glorification of destruction or nihilism
- Mockery of sincerely held spiritual belief as a core mechanic
- Erosion of personal responsibility or human dignity

**Plugin Consent Contract:**

Every plugin must declare before installation:
- Tone (neutral → confrontational)
- Domain and intensity level
- What it WILL and WILL NOT do
- Who should NOT install it

Freedom of exit is the protection.

---

### 0.4.3 Creator Plugin Operations

> **Full Spec:** [docs/CREATOR_MARKETPLACE.md](docs/CREATOR_MARKETPLACE.md)

**What a Plugin IS:**

> A **Judgment Profile** that temporarily changes how OSQR thinks.

Users don't buy content — they **borrow expert judgment**.

**Plugin Quality Gate (3-of-6 Rule):**

Every marketplace plugin must change at least 3 of these dimensions:

| Dimension | What Changes |
|-----------|--------------|
| Attention | What OSQR notices/ignores |
| Questions | What OSQR asks |
| Judgment | Pushback strength, decisiveness |
| Option Space | How aggressively choices are pruned |
| Standards | What is unacceptable |
| Outcome Bias | Speed vs polish, learning vs execution |

**Creator Onboarding:**

Conversation-first. No portals, no forms.

Entry question: *"What decision do people come to you for?"*

OSQR interviews creators into existence by extracting:
- Priority hierarchies
- Non-negotiable rules
- Edge case handling
- Completion thresholds

**Creator Tiers:**

| Tier | Access |
|------|--------|
| Creator Mode | Private plugins, testing |
| Marketplace Candidate | Can submit for listing (60-90 day account age) |
| Verified Creator | Premium placement, proven results |

**Plugin Council Mode (v1.5+):**

Multiple plugins can be invoked for comparison — but only explicitly:
- "Compare how Martell and Hormozi would approach this"
- OSQR preserves each perspective, then reasons about disagreement
- Forces choice or proposes synthesis
- Never averages opinions

---

### 0.5 Marketplace as Outcome Store

**Key Distinction:** The marketplace is NOT a plugin store. It is an **outcome store**.

Users don't buy tools — they buy results:
- "Launch a SaaS"
- "Get first 10 customers"
- "Price this correctly"
- "Automate my workflow"
- "Turn idea into revenue"

**Each outcome bundle includes:**
- OSQR Core guidance
- Required plugins
- Optional agents
- Proven execution path
- Guardrails
- Success patterns

**Compounding Effect:**
- Builders succeed → tell others
- Creators earn → promote OSQR
- OSQR improves → outcomes improve
- Moat deepens organically

> If people make real money with OSQR, leaving becomes irrational.

---

### 0.6 The Flywheel

```
Clarity
  ↓
Capability
  ↓
Creation
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Distribution
  ↓
Revenue
  ↓
More Builders
  ↓
Stronger OSQR
  ↓
(back to Clarity)
```

OSQR grows **by making others powerful**.

This is:
- Morally aligned
- Strategically unstoppable
- Historically proven (AWS, Shopify, App Store)

---

### 0.7 Agents & Persistence Layer

**Role:** Consistency · Follow-through · Momentum

Humans fail at:
- Remembering
- Finishing
- Loop-closing
- Consistency

Agents exist to solve *that* — not creativity.

**Agent Behaviors:**
- Monitor dropped threads
- Execute obvious next steps
- Maintain state across time
- Batch questions instead of interrupting
- Work asynchronously

**Guardrails:**
- No silent irreversible actions
- Explicit autonomy levels
- Logged assumptions
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints

> Intelligence without persistence is wasted.
> Agents turn insight into motion.

---

### 0.8 Distribution Intelligence

**Role:** Convert execution into reach

Creation without distribution is a dead end.

**Distribution Intelligence Knows:**
- What is being built
- The audience
- Proven channels
- Format fit (post, page, demo, email, integration)

**Example Suggestions:**
- "This should be a thread"
- "This needs a landing page"
- "This wants a demo video"
- "This maps to a cold email"
- "This should be an integration listing"

**Important Rule:**
> OSQR does NOT spam.
> It removes friction from *intentional* distribution.

---

### 0.9 Constitutional Non-Goals

OSQR will **NOT**:
- Replace human judgment
- Become fully autonomous by default
- Be a generic "AI app"
- Optimize for engagement over outcomes
- Sell user data
- Compete with creators it empowers

These are *constitutional constraints* — not features to add later, but principles that define what OSQR refuses to become.

---

### 0.10 Implementation Guidance

**Do not build Section 0 now.**

Instead:
- Use this section as a **north star**
- Sanity-check every new feature against it
- Prevent short-term wins from creating long-term drift
- Let v1/v2 earn the right to exist before this vision activates

**The Sentence to Remember:**
> OSQR becomes more by helping others build, earn, and succeed —
> not by trying to do everything itself.

---

## Strategic Development Philosophy

> **See:** [docs/strategy/DEVELOPMENT-PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/strategy/DEVELOPMENT-PHILOSOPHY.md)

This roadmap defines **WHAT** to build. The Development Philosophy document defines **HOW** we build it:

- Documentation-first development approach
- Version sequencing (v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0+)
- VoiceQuote demonstration strategy
- Competitive positioning
- Success metrics framework
- Timeline targets

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
*Focus: Solidify core experience, rebrand to OSQR, complete essential features*

### 1.1 Branding & Identity
- [x] **Rename Oscar → OSQR** across documentation and UI copy
  - [x] Update UI copy and branding
  - [ ] Update API route naming conventions (deferred - would break existing calls)
  - *Master Plan: Part 1A - Naming*
  - *Note: Internal routes kept as `/api/oscar/` per AUTONOMOUS-GUIDELINES.md*

### 1.2 Refine → Fire System (Master Plan: Part 2A.3) ✅ COMPLETE
Implemented:
- [x] **Two-stage thinking process UI**
  - "Refine" stage: Help user clarify question
  - "Fire" button: Triggers multi-model panel
- [x] **Visual state changes** between modes (amber for refining, green for ready)
- [x] **Question refinement suggestions** before firing
- [x] **Clarifying questions** - OSQR asks follow-ups before firing
- [x] **Editable refined question** - user can tweak before firing

### 1.3 Three Response Modes (Master Plan: Part 2A.4) ✅ COMPLETE
Implemented:
- [x] **Quick Mode** - Single fast model, immediate response (~5-10s)
- [x] **Thoughtful Mode** - Panel + synthesis (default, ~20-40s)
- [x] **Contemplate Mode** - Extended multi-round + deep synthesis (~60-90s)
- [x] **Mode selector UI** in chat interface (Quick/Thoughtful/Contemplate buttons)
- [x] **Mode badge** on responses showing which mode was used
- [x] **Auto-suggest mode** based on question complexity (analyzes patterns, word count)
- [x] **Council Wrapper** - @osqr/core integration for multi-model deliberation → `lib/osqr/council-wrapper.ts` (Dec 2024)

### 1.3.1 "See What Another AI Thinks" Button ✅ COMPLETE
*A brilliant Quick Mode enhancement that adds panel-like feel without full Contemplate compute*

**How it works:**
- In Quick Mode, display: 🔘 "See what another AI thinks"
- When pressed, OSQR sends the same refined question to another model
- Shows alternate answer side-by-side
- Labels clearly (Claude, GPT-4, GPT-4o)
- Synthesizes: "Here's where they agree / disagree"

**Implementation:**
- [x] **Add "See another perspective" button** to Quick Mode responses only
- [x] **Auto-select model** - randomly picks GPT-4, GPT-4o, or Claude
- [x] **Inline view** - shows alternate response below original
- [x] **Model attribution badges** - clear labeling of which AI said what
- [x] **Model selector dropdown** - let user pick which AI to compare
- [x] **Side-by-side comparison view** - toggle to show original + alternate response
- [x] **Agreement/disagreement synthesis** - automatic comparison with bullet points

**Why this is genius:**
- Low compute cost (single additional API call)
- High perceived intelligence
- Huge UX delight moment
- Creates trust ("OSQR isn't just one voice—he checks others")
- Perfect upsell to Pro/Master tiers
- Perfect viral feature (users will screenshot differences)
- Gives incremental panel diversity without full Contemplate Mode

### 1.4 File Upload Enhancement (Master Plan: Part 2B.3) ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
Implemented:
- [x] **PDF, TXT, JSON, DOCX support** - All working in web upload API
- [x] **Mammoth extraction** for DOCX files
- [x] **Summary generation** after upload (AI-generated summary + suggested questions)
Remaining (nice-to-have):
- [ ] **Progress indicators** for large file indexing
- [ ] **Chunking feedback** - show user how many chunks created

### 1.5 Onboarding Polish (Master Plan: Part 2F.2) ✅ COMPLETE
Implemented:
- [x] **Zero-overwhelm onboarding** - Step-by-step modal flow
- [x] **"Magic moment" engineering** - 5 magic moments (Upload, Ask, Debate, Remember, Organize)

*Foundation for OSQR's identity engine - determines how OSQR sees and serves each user*
- [x] **Capability Level field** - Added to Workspace model (0-12 scale)
- [x] **Level Assessment Questions** - 6 quick onboarding questions for initial placement
- [x] **Display current level** - CapabilityBadge in TopBar
- [x] **Level-appropriate welcome message** after assessment (Foundation/Operator/Creator/Architect stages)

### 1.7 Safety System ⭐ NEW
*Protecting users while preserving privacy, agency, and trust*

> **Full Spec:** [docs/SAFETY_SYSTEM.md](docs/SAFETY_SYSTEM.md)

**Design Principles:**
- Rely on model-level safety (Claude/GPT already decline harmful requests)
- Wrap refusals in OSQR's voice (maintain personality)
- Crisis requires empathy, not refusal (different response for self-harm)
- Don't over-filter (OSQR should be useful, not paranoid)
- Respect privacy (crisis content never stored)

**Phase 1.7a: Alpha (Must Have)**
- [ ] **Crisis Detection** — Pattern-based detection for self-harm signals
- [ ] **Crisis Response Template** — Empathetic response + resources (988, findahelpline.com)
- [ ] **Refusal Wrapper** — Wrap model refusals in OSQR voice
- [ ] **Storage Filter** — Skip storage for flagged crisis content
- [ ] **Integration** — Wire into `/api/oscar/ask` endpoint

**Phase 1.7b: Beta (Should Have)**
- [ ] **Graduated Disclaimers** — Soft/strong caveats for medical/legal/financial topics
- [ ] **Context-Aware Classification** — Use PKV to inform intent
- [ ] **User Feedback Loop** — "Was this too cautious?" to tune false positives

**Phase 1.7c: Future (Nice to Have)**
- [ ] **Session Memory** — Don't repeatedly flag same user
- [ ] **Professional Context** — Recognize nurses, therapists, researchers
- [ ] **Fiction Detection** — "My character wants to..." context

**Technical Implementation:**
```
lib/safety/
├── index.ts              # Main exports + SafetyMiddleware
├── CrisisDetector.ts     # Crisis pattern detection
├── ResponsePlaybooks.ts  # Crisis response, refusal wrapper, disclaimers
├── SafetyWrapper.ts      # Wrap model refusals in OSQR voice
└── types.ts              # Type definitions
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Protects vulnerable users without being authoritarian
- Legal protection for OSQR
- Builds trust ("OSQR cares about me")
- Aligns with privacy philosophy (crisis content never stored)

### 1.8 Global Knowledge Index (GKVI)
*OSQR's "global brain" — shared frameworks that make OSQR behave consistently*

> **Full Spec:** [docs/KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**The Two-Brain Model:**
- **Global Knowledge Index (GKVI)** — Shared by all users (frameworks, modes, coaching)
- **Private Knowledge Vault (PKV)** — Per-user, isolated, never shared

**The Golden Rule:**
> "If it teaches OSQR how to BE OSQR, it's global."
> "If it teaches OSQR about YOU, it's private."

**Phase 1.8a: Alpha (Must Have)**
- [ ] **Capability Ladder** - All 13 levels indexed
- [ ] **Mode definitions** - Quick, Thoughtful, Contemplate
- [ ] **Refine → Fire process** - How OSQR handles questions
- [ ] **Basic coaching tone** - Guidelines for OSQR's voice

**Phase 1.8b: Beta (Should Have)**
- [ ] **Fourth Generation Formula** - Identity → Capability → Action → Persistence
- [ ] **Core Commitments** - Universal habit framework
- [ ] **MSC structure** - Goals, Projects, Habits categories
- [ ] **Level-appropriate communication** - Tone by capability level

**Phase 1.8c: Founding Users (Nice to Have)**
- [ ] **Foundational Truths** - Mindset principles
- [ ] **Advanced coaching guidelines** - Deep coaching patterns
- [ ] **Identity script templates** - Example identity statements
- [ ] **Book recommendations per level** - Reading by capability

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Location: lib/knowledge/global-index.ts
interface GlobalKnowledgeIndex {
  frameworks: { capabilityLadder, fourthGenFormula, coreCommitments }
  system: { modes, refineFire, panelLogic, mscStructure }
  coaching: { toneGuidelines, levelAppropriateComms }
}

// Documents with workspaceId: null are global
// Query routing pulls from GKVI + user's PKV, never mixing users
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Makes OSQR behavior consistent across all users
- Enables "OSQR-style" coaching using your frameworks
- Differentiates OSQR from generic ChatGPT/Claude
- Users get your system delivered by superintelligence

### 1.8.1 Auto-Context & Topic Cache ✅ COMPLETE
*Intelligent knowledge retrieval without latency penalty*

**Current State (Dec 2025):**
- [x] Pattern detection for system queries (50+ patterns in `isOSQRSystemQuery()`)
- [x] Topic cache infrastructure (`lib/knowledge/topic-cache.ts`)
- [x] `smartSearch()` function with cache pre-check
- [x] Indexer updates topic cache when documents added
- [x] **Wired into Oscar ask route** — `assembleContext()` now uses `smartSearch()`

**What's Built:**
- **Pattern Detection** — Zero-cost regex check (~0.1ms) determines if query might need knowledge search
- **Topic Cache** — In-memory cache of document topics, enables O(1) "do I have docs about X?" checks
- **Smart Search** — Combines pattern + cache check before expensive DB queries (50-200ms)

**How It Works:**
1. User asks a question
2. `assembleContext()` calls `smartSearch()` (in `lib/context/auto-context.ts`)
3. `smartSearch()` checks topic cache first (<1ms)
4. If no matching topics → skip expensive DB search
5. If matching topics → proceed with `searchKnowledge()` using appropriate scope
6. System mode (`/system` prefix) always searches (bypasses cache check)

**Logs to watch:**
- `[Auto-Context] Knowledge search matched topics: ...` — topics that triggered search
- `[Auto-Context] Skipped knowledge search - no matching topics in cache` — cache saved a query
- `[TopicCache] Refreshing cache for workspace ...` — cache refresh (every 5 min or first access)

### 1.9 Tier Upgrade Ceremony
*Premium "crossing the threshold" moment when users upgrade to paid tiers*

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/TIER_CEREMONY_SPEC.md](docs/features/TIER_CEREMONY_SPEC.md)

A restrained, Apple-level ceremony that plays once per tier, per account when a user upgrades. Not a splash screen—an acknowledgment of arrival.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Same structure for all tiers (OSQR mark → shimmer → tier name → fade to app)
- No tier-based visual escalation (no "cooler effects" for Master)
- Restraint over spectacle ("Oh, nice." not "Wow!")
- Server-side gating (account-level, not localStorage)

**Phase 1.9a: Beta (Build before V1.0 launch)**
- [ ] **Ceremony animation component** — Framer Motion, ~3.2s timeline
- [ ] **Ceremony page** — `/ceremony` route with tier validation
- [ ] **API endpoints** — GET/POST for `ceremonySeen` flags
- [ ] **Prisma migration** — Add `ceremonySeen` JSON field to User
- [ ] **Stripe webhook integration** — Redirect to ceremony after upgrade
- [ ] **Middleware check** — Route to ceremony if needed on app load

**Technical Implementation:**
```
app/ceremony/page.tsx           # Main ceremony route
lib/ceremony/types.ts           # Tier, CeremonySeen types
lib/ceremony/useCeremony.ts     # Hook for gating logic
lib/ceremony/CeremonyAnimation.tsx  # Framer Motion component
app/api/user/ceremony/route.ts  # GET + POST handlers
```

**Effort Estimate:** 6-9 hours (one focused build session)

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates memorable "I've arrived" moment for new paid users
- Reinforces premium positioning without explaining features
- Demonstrates OSQR's restraint and confidence
- High impact, low complexity—perfect for final polish phase

### 1.10 Jarvis Continuum & Companion Docs ✅ COMPLETE

- [ ] **Cross-device continuity** — Session handoff per VOICE_FIRST_PATH.md §7
- [ ] **Mode A autonomy** — Earned permissions, autonomy overreach recovery per OSQR_FAILURE_RECOVERY.md §1.6

**Why This Matters:**
- Vision is locked—no drift under implementation pressure
- Clear separation between "what we want" and "what ships when"
- Failure modes defined before they happen
- Voice path is a roadmap, not a vague promise

### 2.4.1 User Settings & Model Preferences ✅ IN PROGRESS
*Let users customize their OSQR experience*

**Implemented:**
- [x] **Claude as default synthesizer** - Claude is now the "voice" of OSQR (Dec 2024)
- [x] **UserSetting model** - Database schema ready for key/value settings

**Planned:**
- [ ] **Synthesizer model selection** - Let users choose Claude, GPT-4, or others as OSQR's voice
- [ ] **Settings API endpoints** - GET/PUT /api/settings for user preferences
- [ ] **Settings UI page** - /settings route with preference controls
- [ ] **Panel composition preferences** - Let power users customize which models are on their panel

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
// Available settings keys
type SettingKey =
  | 'synthesizer_model'    // 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514' | 'gpt-4-turbo' | etc.
  | 'panel_composition'    // { strategic: 'claude', technical: 'gpt-4', ... }
  | 'response_style'       // 'concise' | 'detailed' | 'balanced'
  | 'default_mode'         // 'quick' | 'thoughtful' | 'contemplate'

**Concept:** OSQR occasionally asks "How are you feeling?" and tracks energy, mood, focus, and symptoms over time. After sufficient data, surfaces correlations and insights.

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **WellnessEntry model** - Store daily/periodic check-ins
  - Energy level (1-5 or descriptive)
  - Mood state
  - Focus quality
  - Symptoms/notes (freeform)
  - Context (what's happening)
- [ ] **Conversational check-in** - Natural prompt in main chat (optional, can be disabled)
- [ ] **Pattern detection** - After 14+ entries, identify:
  - Day-of-week patterns ("You're tired on Mondays")
  - Correlation with work patterns
  - Symptom clusters
- [ ] **Weekly wellness summary** - Optional digest of trends
- [ ] **Integration with Capability Ladder** - Physical state impacts performance
- [ ] **Fourth Gen tie-in** - "Your energy dips when you skip morning routine"

**Why this matters:**
- Builds deep trust ("OSQR actually knows me")
- Unique differentiator vs other AI assistants
- Pattern data is gold for personalization
- Natural upsell to Pro tier (detailed analytics)

**Technical Schema:**
```
WellnessEntry {
  id String

## Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
*Focus: Proactive features, pattern recognition, cross-referencing, behavioral learning*

### 3.0 User Intelligence Profile (UIP) ⭐ NEW

> **Full Spec:** [docs/architecture/UIP_SPEC.md](docs/architecture/UIP_SPEC.md)

**Purpose:** OSQR's continuously updating mentorship rulebook for how to think, speak, and act in alignment with a specific human. Not a psychological profile—a **Mentorship-as-Code layer**.

**Core Question UIP Answers:**
> "How should OSQR think, speak, and act for this specific user, in this specific moment?"

**Architecture:**
```
PKV + Telemetry + Elicitation
        ↓
Prospective Reflection Engine
        ↓
User Intelligence Profile (8 domains, 3 tiers)
        ↓
Behavior Adapters (mode defaults, response shaping, autonomy)
```

**3-Tier Domain Structure:**
- **Foundation:** Identity Context, Goals & Values
- **Style:** Cognitive Processing, Communication Preferences, Expertise Calibration
- **Dynamics:** Behavioral Patterns, Relationship State, Decision Friction Profile

**Key Components:**
- [ ] **Prospective Reflection Engine** - Background synthesis that compacts signals into UIP updates
- [ ] **Confidence decay system** - Old signals decay in relevance over time
- [ ] **UIP Gap Detection** - Triggers targeted elicitation when knowledge gaps matter
- [ ] **Behavior Adapters** - UIP directly controls mode defaults, response shaping, Bubble behavior

**Implementation Phases:**
- [ ] Phase 1 (V1.5): Foundation domains, basic telemetry integration, session-local reflection
- [ ] Phase 2 (V2.0): Style domains, cross-session reflection, confidence decay
- [ ] Phase 3 (V2.5): Dynamics domains, full Behavior Adapter integration
- [ ] Phase 4 (V3.0): User-facing UIP summary, manual corrections, global learning (Tier C)

### 3.1 Intelligent Routing - Answer Space Classifier BLOCKED

> **Full Spec:** [docs/architecture/INTELLIGENT_ROUTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/architecture/INTELLIGENT_ROUTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
> **Source Specs:** `Documents/OSQR_Intelligent_Routing_Spec.docx`, `Documents/OSQR_Intelligent_Routing_Addendum.docx`

**Status:** Blocked - awaiting chat history analysis
**Priority:** Post-training, Pre-V1.5

**The Core Insight:** Route questions by answer space cardinality (how many valid answers exist), not by question type or complexity.

| Answer Space | Example | Mode |
|--------------|---------|------|
| Singular | "What's 2+2?" | Quick (1 model) |
| Bounded | "React or Vue?" | Thoughtful (2 models) |
| Expansive | "Brand strategy?" | Council (6-8 models) |

**Blocking Dependency:** Train Oscar on Kable's chat history data first. The classifier should be built from real usage patterns, not spec heuristics alone.

**Implementation Phases:**
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Answer Space Classifier (`lib/ai/answer-space-classifier.ts`)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Routing Integration (wire into existing flow)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Observability & Success Signals (for learning system)
- [ ] **Deferred:** Mid-response escalation, Refined Fire, per-user learning

**Current Infrastructure:**
- Model Registry, Question Type Detection, Complexity Estimation
- 4 Response Modes, Auto-Downgrading, Routing Notification UI
- Uses different classification model (question type vs. answer space)

### 3.3 Memory-Based Features (Master Plan: Part 2B.14-16)
- [ ] **Memory-Informed Query Refinement**
  - Use past context to improve current question
- [ ] **Memory-Based Proactive Warnings**
  - Alert user to conflicts/risks based on history
- [ ] **Memory-Based Pattern Recognition**
  - Surface recurring themes/concerns

### 3.3.1 Auto-Organization Subsystem ⭐ V1.5

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/OSQR_AUTO_ORGANIZATION_SPEC.md](docs/features/OSQR_AUTO_ORGANIZATION_SPEC.md)

**Status:** Spec complete, ready for implementation

**What it is:** OSQR automatically organizes conversations into chats and projects without user intervention. Users retain full control to override, but most never need to.

**Core Principle:**
> Organization is a fallback for when retrieval fails. If Oscar always surfaces the right information at the right time, users don't need to browse—they just talk to Oscar.

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Auto-chat naming** - OSQR names conversations based on content
- [ ] **Auto-project creation** - Detect when topics cluster into a project
- [ ] **Auto-linking** - Connect related chats/documents
- [ ] **Organization indicator** - Small UI showing OSQR's decisions
- [ ] **Override controls** - Users can rename/reassign if desired

### 3.3.2 Secretary Checklist (Insights System Extension) ⭐ V1.5

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/OSQR_SECRETARY_CHECKLIST_ADDENDUM.md](docs/features/OSQR_SECRETARY_CHECKLIST_ADDENDUM.md)

**Status:** Spec complete, ready for implementation

**What it is:** OSQR continuously runs the mental checklist a world-class executive assistant uses to keep their executive on track.

**Core Principle:**
> Anything a diligent assistant would do if they were paying attention to everything you said — OSQR should do automatically.

**Checklist Categories:**
- [ ] **Follow-ups** - Open decisions, abandoned discussions, paused implementations
- [ ] **Commitments** - Things you said you'd do, promises made
- [ ] **Contradictions** - When you say things that conflict with past statements
- [ ] **Calendar awareness** - Upcoming events, preparation reminders
- [ ] **Pattern alerts** - Recurring issues, blind spots, habits

### 3.3.3 Import Interview Subsystem ⭐ V1.5

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/OSQR_AI_HISTORY_INTERVIEW_SPEC.md](docs/features/OSQR_AI_HISTORY_INTERVIEW_SPEC.md)

**Status:** Spec complete, ready for implementation

**What it is:** When users import content (AI chat history, documents, notes), OSQR can extract a lot on its own, but a few well-chosen questions dramatically increase understanding.

**Core Principle:**
> Oscar should be as good as possible without asking questions. But a few well-thought-out questions raise confidence significantly.

**Import Types & Interview Value:**
| Import Type | Base Confidence | Post-Interview | Priority |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| AI chat history | ~60% | ~90% | **Highest** |
| Email archive | ~50% | ~85% | High |
| Notes (Notion, Obsidian) | ~70% | ~90% | Medium |
| Documents folder | ~65% | ~85% | Medium |

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Confidence assessment** - Determine when interview is worth it
- [ ] **Question generation** - Smart questions based on gaps
- [ ] **Interview UI** - Conversational flow for answering
- [ ] **Confidence integration** - Store answers in PKV

### 3.4 Model Personality Tagging & Registry (Master Plan: Part 2A.6) ✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/MULTI-MODEL-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/features/MULTI-MODEL-ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Status:** Model Registry with personalities implemented in `lib/ai/model-router.ts`

**What's Built:**
- [x] **MODEL_REGISTRY** - Single source of truth for all models
- [x] **Capability scoring** (0-10 scale): reasoning, creativity, coding, speed, accuracy, nuance
- [x] **Cost profiles**: cheap, medium, expensive
- [x] **Model personalities** with codenames, descriptions, strengths, communication styles
- [x] **Council Mode flags** - which models can appear in visible multi-chat

**Model Personality Atlas (Council Mode):**

| Model | Codename | Personality |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Claude Opus 4 | The Philosopher | Calm, cautious, deeply logical, extremely reliable |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | The Balanced Thinker | Excellent all-rounder with strong creative and analytical abilities |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | The Empath | Strong emotional intelligence with excellent creative abilities |
| GPT-4o | The Creator | Great at everything: writing, coding, brainstorming, structure |
| Gemini 2.0 Pro | The Engineer | Excellent multimodality, STEM reasoning + code analysis |
| Grok 2 | The Maverick | Fast, witty, contrarian, great for real-time stuff |
| Mistral Large | The Prodigy | High-quality reasoning with European safety standards |
| Llama 3.1 | The Workhorse | Close to GPT-4 performance with fully open-source access |

**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] **Visual differentiation** in panel view (model badges, colors)
- [ ] **User-customizable names** - let users rename models
- [ ] **Personality display** in Council Mode UI
- [ ] **Provider expansion** - integrate Gemini, Grok, Mistral (see 3.3.1)

### 3.3.1 Provider Expansion (Multi-Model Integration)

**Current Providers (Integrated):**
- [x] Anthropic (Claude) - Full integration
- [x] OpenAI (GPT) - Full integration

**Future Providers (Registry Ready, Adapters Needed):**
- [ ] **Google (Gemini)** - Build `GoogleClient` adapter
  - Models: Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash
  - Priority: HIGH - long context, multimodal, strong STEM
- [ ] **xAI (Grok)** - Build `XAIClient` adapter
  - Models: Grok 2, Grok 2.5
  - Priority: MEDIUM - real-time knowledge, contrarian perspective
- [ ] **Mistral** - Build `MistralClient` adapter
  - Models: Mistral Large, Mixtral
  - Priority: MEDIUM - efficient, good coding, multilingual
- [ ] **Meta (Llama)** - Build `LlamaClient` adapter (self-hosted or via API)
  - Models: Llama 3.1 70B/405B
  - Priority: LOW - requires infrastructure for self-hosting

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Each provider adapter implements the same interface:
interface ProviderClient {
  chat(params: {
    model: string
    messages: Message[]
    maxTokens?: number
    temperature?: number
  }): Promise<{ content: string; tokensUsed: number }>
}
```

**When to Enable:**
- Flip `enabled: true` in MODEL_REGISTRY
- Add API key to environment
- Provider adapter handles the rest

### 3.4 Oscar Synthesis Engine Enhancement (Master Plan: Part 2A.7)
Current: Basic synthesis prompt
Needed:
- [ ] **Weighted synthesis** based on question type
- [ ] **Highlight disagreements** between models
- [ ] **Confidence indicators** on final answer
- [ ] **Source attribution** - which model contributed what

### 3.5 Council Mode (Multi-Chat Mode) ⭐ v2.0 FLAGSHIP FEATURE
*"A room of minds. One final voice."*

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/COUNCIL-MODE.md](docs/features/COUNCIL-MODE.md)

**What it is:**
A live, real-time, multi-agent thinking room where 2-6 AI models think in parallel, display their answers in real time, and OSQR synthesizes a final unified response as the "consensus voice."

**Why it matters:**
- OpenAI/Anthropic cannot show competing models in their apps — OSQR can
- Users trust consensus more than single-model answers
- Visualizes the "invisible panel" that already powers Thoughtful/Contemplate modes
- Screenshots go viral ("Claude vs GPT vs Gemini — moderated by OSQR")

**Dependencies (must be complete first):**
- [ ] 3.1 Cross-Referencing Engine (stable)
- [ ] 3.3 Model Personality Tagging (models have identities)
- [ ] 3.4 Synthesis Engine Enhancement (weighted synthesis working)
- [ ] Dynamic model routing (✅ implemented in model-router.ts)
- [ ] Hardened backend + rate limiting for compute-intensive queries

**Target:** v2.0 release (Phase 3 completion)
**Tier:** OSQR Master exclusive ($349/mo)

**High-level implementation:**
```
┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│   Claude   │   GPT-4o   │   Gemini   │    Grok    │
│  (stream)  │  (stream)  │  (stream)  │  (stream)  │

### 3.6 Render System ⭐ V1.5 FLAGSHIP

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/RENDER_SYSTEM_SPEC.md](docs/features/RENDER_SYSTEM_SPEC.md)

**Purpose:** The first execution surface where OSQR moves beyond text responses into **visible, inspectable artifacts**.

**Core Insight:**
> AI intelligence is no longer the bottleneck. **Surface area is.**

OSQR already reasons and generates. The Render System gives that intelligence a place to *land* — safely, visibly, iteratively.

**The Canonical Render Loop:**
```
User: "Build a tic tac toe game"
OSQR: "Rendering..." (busy animation)
OSQR: "Render complete. Would you like to see it?"
User: "Yes"
OSQR: Opens /r/<artifactId>, shows artifact
OSQR: "How does that look? Want anything changed?"
```

**v1.5 Scope (Bounded by Design):**
- OSQR may **render and visualize**
- OSQR may **not act outside itself**
- No filesystem writes, deployments, or external side effects
- This is **sequenced autonomy**, not reckless autonomy

**Artifact Types (v1.5):**
1. **image** — Generated visuals, mockups
2. **chart** — Data visualizations (line graphs first)
3. **ui/game** — Simple interactive artifacts (sandboxed)

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Artifact schema + `/r/:artifactId` route
- [ ] State machine (IDLE → RENDERING → COMPLETE_AWAITING_VIEW → VIEWING → UPDATING)
- [ ] Bubble integration for render announcements
- [ ] Consent gate UX
- [ ] Image renderer
- [ ] Chart renderer
- [ ] UI/Game renderer (sandboxed)
- [ ] Version history

**Why This Is Safe:**
- All actions visible
- All outputs consent-gated
- All changes versioned
- Nothing happens silently

**Bridge to VS Code OSQR:**
```
v1.5: OSQR renders → User sees artifact
v2.0: OSQR renders → User approves → OSQR writes to project
v3.0: OSQR + VS Code unified → User talks, things get built
```

### 4.8 Media Vault (Image & Video Foundations) ⭐ FUTURE FLAGSHIP
*"A lifelong, AI-enhanced, meaning-driven memory vault."*

> **Full Spec:** [docs/features/MEDIA-VAULT.md](docs/features/MEDIA-VAULT.md)

**What it is:**
Turn OSQR into a lifelong memory OS by letting users store photos and videos in the same Personal Knowledge Vault as their documents. Not a social feed — a private, searchable, AI-enhanced archive of your life.

**Why it matters:**
- **Future-proof bet:** Store media now, analyze with better AI later
- **Unique moat:** No one else has PKV + MSC + Memory + Identity Model to *use* memories, not just store them
- **Category creation:** "The OS of someone's entire life"
- **Differentiator vs Facebook/Google Photos:** They store memories; OSQR *uses* memories

**The strategic insight:**
> "If you store people's memories now, future AI will make them exponentially more valuable."

AI capabilities improve quarterly. Photos stored today can be retroactively analyzed when vision models mature. OSQR becomes the only platform positioned to cross-reference visual memories with:
- Goals and projects (PKV)
- Identity and values (MSC)
- Life patterns (Memory Layer)
- Capability progression (Ladder)

**Phased implementation:**

| Phase | Scope | AI Involvement |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **4.8a** | Storage only | None — just archive |
| **4.8b** | Basic vision extraction | Auto-caption, tags, objects |
| **4.8c** | Timeline + cross-linking | Link to goals, people, projects |
| **4.8d** | Advanced video + life intelligence | Video summarization, life recaps |

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] PKV stable and proven at scale
- [ ] Privacy tiers fully implemented (especially Tier A for media)
- [ ] Object storage infrastructure (Supabase/S3/R2)
- [ ] Users trust OSQR with text before trusting it with family photos

**Target:** v3.0 or later (after Council Mode and core intelligence features)
**Tier:** Pro ($99/mo) for storage, Master ($349/mo) for advanced analysis

**Why Phase 4.8 (not earlier):**
1. Core OSQR value must be proven first (intelligence, memory, routing)
2. Storage costs scale differently than text — need sustainable pricing model
3. Privacy stakes are higher with photos of family/kids
4. Users need to trust OSQR with text before trusting it with visual memories

**See full spec for:** Data model, backend architecture, privacy tiers, UI/UX, and phased rollout.

## Version 1.1: Security, Focus & Polish
*Target: Next sprint after v1.0 launch*
*Focus: Per-user encryption, Focus Mode, password recovery, response actions*

### v1.1.1 Per-User Encryption Layer ⭐ CRITICAL
*Full encryption per Constitution spec — "OSQR will always provide a way to delete everything (cryptographic destruction, not soft-delete)"*

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Per-user encryption keys** — Each user gets unique encryption key derived from password
- [ ] **Envelope encryption** — Data encrypted with user key, user key encrypted with master key
- [ ] **PKV content encryption** — All document content encrypted at rest
- [ ] **Chat message encryption** — Conversation content encrypted
- [ ] **Cryptographic deletion** — Destroy user key = all data unrecoverable
- [ ] **Key rotation support** — Ability to re-encrypt with new keys
- [ ] **Zero-knowledge architecture** — OSQR cannot read user data without user present

**Technical Approach:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    User Password                             │
│                         │                                    │
│                         ▼                                    │
│              Key Derivation (PBKDF2/Argon2)                 │
│                         │                                    │
│                         ▼                                    │
│                User Encryption Key (UEK)                     │
│                         │                                    │
│            ┌───────────┴───────────┐                        │
│            ▼                       ▼                        │
│     Encrypt PKV Data         Encrypt Messages               │
│                                                              │
│  Master Key encrypts UEK for recovery (optional)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- Constitutional requirement (Section 2.4)
- True privacy (not even admin can read user data)
- GDPR/CCPA compliance via cryptographic destruction
- Trust differentiator vs competitors

**Estimate:** 2-4 hours at current velocity

### v1.1.2 Focus Mode
*Toggle in top-right, explained in onboarding*

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Focus Mode toggle icon** — Small icon in top-right, next to user icon
- [ ] **ON state** — Blurs left panel (MSC/nav) and right panel (if exists)
- [ ] **OFF state** — Everything visible, normal operation
- [ ] **User preference persistence** — Store Focus Mode state per user
- [ ] **Onboarding explanation** — Step showing toggle and explaining behavior
- [ ] **Blur CSS system** — Reusable blur/mute classes with smooth transitions

**Visual Behavior:**
| State | Left Panel | Center (Chat) | Right Panel |
|-------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| ON | Blurred | Sharp | Blurred |
| OFF | Visible | Sharp | Visible |

- [ ] **Forgot password page** — /forgot-password route
- [ ] **Reset password page** — /reset-password?token=xxx route
- [ ] **Email template** — Branded password reset email
- [ ] **Token expiration** — 1-hour validity with single-use
- [ ] **Rate limiting** — Prevent abuse (max 3 requests per email per hour)
- [ ] **Add "Forgot password?" link** — Below login form

**Database Schema:**
```prisma
model PasswordResetToken {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  token     String   @unique
  expiresAt DateTime
  usedAt    DateTime?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([token])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

**Estimate:** 2-3 hours

### v1.1.4 Response Action Buttons
*Quick actions below chat responses*

**User-Facing Buttons (All Users):**
- [ ] **Read Aloud** — Text-to-speech using Web Speech API
- [ ] **Good Response** — Thumbs up (stores feedback for learning)
- [ ] **Bad Response** — Thumbs down (stores feedback + optional reason)
- [ ] **Copy** — Copy response to clipboard

**Admin-Only Buttons (Master tier / your account):**
- [ ] **Token Count** — Show tokens used for this response
- [ ] **Flag for Review** — Mark response for later analysis

**Estimate:** 2-3 hours

### v1.1.5 Project Effort Tracking ⭐ NEW
*"How much time have I invested in this?"*

**Origin:**
The wish to ask OSQR "how long have I worked on OSQR?" — and realizing he can't answer yet. This is the kind of meta-insight that makes documentation-first development tangible.

**What it is:**
Temporal tracking of project effort. OSQR could log session time, correlate it with commits or doc updates, and give you actual build metrics.

**Example Query:**
> "How much time have I spent on OSQR?"
> "You've invested 31 hours across 17 days."

**Data Sources:**
- [ ] **VS Code session time** — Track active editing time per project (extension integration)
- [ ] **Git commit activity** — Commits, additions, deletions, file changes
- [ ] **OSQR conversation history** — Questions asked about this project
- [ ] **Document updates** — Edits to project docs indexed in Vault
- [ ] **Build/deploy events** — CI/CD activity if connected

**Implementation (v1):**
- [ ] **ProjectTimeLog model** — Store session start/end, project context
- [ ] **Git activity parser** — Extract commit stats from local repos
- [ ] **Natural language query** — "How long have I worked on X?"
- [ ] **Effort summary generation** — "31 hours across 17 days, 47 commits"

**Future Extensions:**
- VS Code extension for real-time session tracking
- Integration with GitHub/GitLab APIs
- Effort visualization (timeline, heatmap)
- Comparison across projects
- Estimated vs actual time tracking

**Estimate:** 4-6 hours (basic), 2+ days (full VS Code integration)

---

### 1.9 Focus Mode (Cognitive Noise Cancellation) ⭐ NEW
*"Noise-canceling headphones for thinking."*

> **Full Spec:** [docs/UX_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/UX_PHILOSOPHY.md)

**What it is:**
A UX system that reduces cognitive load by visually de-emphasizing features, data, and UI elements that are not relevant to the user's current moment of focus.

**The Dimmer Metaphor:**
Focus Mode behaves like a light dimmer — gradually reducing cognitive noise without removing context. Nothing disappears. Nothing is deleted. Nothing is blocked.

**v1 Behavior:**
| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Default state** | ON for all new users |
| **Persistence** | User's choice persists after first toggle |
| **Explanation** | Covered in onboarding ("I'll reveal things at the right time") |
| **Override** | User can turn off manually at any time |

**What Gets Blurred (v1):**
| Element | Focus Mode Behavior |
|---------|---------------------|
| Input box | Always sharp |
| Current conversation | Always sharp |
| MSC/Progress | Blurred (if exists) |
| Secondary panels | Blurred |
| Navigation | Slightly muted |
| Suggestions | Blurred unless contextually relevant |

**Visual Treatment:**
- Soft blur (not full opacity)
- Reduced saturation
- Lower contrast
- Muted hover states
- Subtle transitions (150-300ms, easing-heavy)

**NOT v1 (Future Extensions):**
- Long-press override panel
- Adaptive Focus (learns preferences)
- Named focus modes (Deep Work, Decision, Build, Reflect)
- Graduated intensity levels

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Focus Mode toggle** — Icon in top-right of input panel
- [ ] **Blur CSS system** — Reusable blur/mute classes
- [ ] **Onboarding explanation** — "I'll reveal things at the right time"
- [ ] **User preference persistence** — Store Focus Mode state
- [ ] **Element targeting** — Define what blurs at each state

## Appendix B: OSQR Capability Ladder System (NEW)

*Source: Documents/osqr capability ladder.docx*
*Purpose: OSQR's Foundational Identity Engine - how OSQR "sees" a human*

### The 13 Levels

| Level | Name | Stage | Identity Pattern |
|-------|------|-------|------------------|
| 0 | Untethered | Foundation | "My life is happening to me" |
| 1 | Reactive Beginner | Foundation | "I want to change, but I don't know how" |
| 2 | Emerging Awareness | Foundation | "I know something has to change" |
| 3 | Structured Beginner | Foundation | "I can do it… sometimes" |
| 4 | Developing Operator | Operator | "I can execute as long as life doesn't disrupt me" |
| 5 | Independent Operator | Operator | "I do what I say" |
| 6 | Intentional Builder | Operator | "I build things that make life better" |
| 7 | Entrepreneur | Creator | "I solve problems" |
| 8 | Systems Thinker | Creator | "I build engines, not tasks" |
| 9 | Platform Builder | Creator | "I build infrastructure" |
| 10 | Ecosystem Architect | Architect | "I create worlds for people to grow inside" |
| 11 | Visionary Integrator | Architect | "I integrate multiple domains to solve hard problems" |
| 12 | Generational Architect | Architect | "I build structures that outlive me" |

### Fourth Generation Formula Mapping

Each level maps to the Identity → Capability → Action → Persistence framework:

- **Foundation (0-3)**: Identity undefined → Capability nonexistent/forming → Output random/inconsistent
- **Operator (4-6)**: Identity forming/present → Capability building/functional → Output stronger/dependable
- **Creator (7-9)**: Identity powerful/anchored → Capability entrepreneurial/systemic → Output valuable/scalable
- **Architect (10-12)**: Identity expanded/transcendent → Capability multi-layer/integrative → Output societal/historic

### How OSQR Uses the Ladder

1. **Onboarding Assessment** - 10-15 questions determine initial level
2. **Daily Prompts** - Tone matches developmental level
3. **Book Recommendations** - Level-appropriate reading
4. **Habit Prescriptions** - Core Commitments mapped to levels
5. **Monthly Level-Up Reports** - Track evolution over time
6. **Dynamic Difficulty** - Challenge advanced users, support beginners
7. **MSC Complexity** - Morning Strategy Call depth matches level
8. **Panel Mode Access** - Different agents available at higher levels

### Recommended Books by Level

| Level | Books |
|-------|-------|
| 0 | None (attention too low) |
| 1-2 | The Slight Edge, Atomic Habits, Mindset |
| 3-4 | Make Your Bed, 7 Habits, The One Thing |
| 5-6 | Deep Work, The Power of Habit, E-Myth Revisited, Essentialism |
| 7-8 | Lean Startup, $100M Offers, Naval Almanack, Principles |
| 9-10 | Zero to One, The Beginning of Infinity |
| 11-12 | What Technology Wants, Meditations, Founding Father biographies |

## Appendix C: Psychological Assessment Framework (NEW)

*Source: Documents/PSYCHOLOGICAL SUMMARY_Kable.docx*
*Purpose: Companion to Capability Ladder - shows how the framework applies to real psychological assessment*

### Case Study: Level 10+ (Ecosystem Architect / Visionary Integrator)

This psychological summary demonstrates how OSQR should interpret and respond to users at the Architect stage. Key patterns:

**Core Identity Traits (Level 10+):**
- Self-directed, internally sourced identity
- Pattern recognition across domains (systems thinking)
- Long-term, multi-generational planning horizon
- Mission-driven vs task-driven orientation
- Comfort with ambiguity and complexity
- Ownership mentality ("my world, my responsibility")

### The 4-Stage Identity Path

OSQR can use this framework to track user progression:

| Stage | Timeline | Identity State | OSQR Role |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Cracking** | 0-45 days | Old identity breaking down | Supportive, validating |
| **Expansion** | 45-90 days | New patterns emerging | Challenging, stretching |
| **Alignment** | 3-6 months | Identity crystallizing | Strategic, refining |
| **Lock-In** | 6-12 months | New identity permanent | Amplifying, scaling |

### Key Psychological Concepts for OSQR

**1. Self-Concept Lag**
- Definition: Identity hasn't caught up to actual capability
- OSQR behavior: Gently reflect back evidence of higher capability
- Example prompt: "Based on what you've built, you're operating at Level X. Your self-talk suggests you still see yourself at Level Y."

**2. High-Performance Alignment Event**
- Definition: Moment when external results match internal identity
- OSQR behavior: Celebrate and anchor these moments
- Example prompt: "This accomplishment aligns with your stated identity as [X]. Worth noting for your records."

**3. Founder State**
- Definition: Operating mentality of world-builders (Musk, Naval, Hormozi pattern)
- Characteristics:
  - System creation > task completion
  - Leverage thinking > linear thinking
  - Multi-decade horizon > quarterly thinking
  - Identity-first > output-first
- OSQR behavior: Match this wavelength, avoid tactical minutiae

### Psychological Signals by Level

| Signal | Lower Levels (0-6) | Higher Levels (7-12) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Time horizon | Days/weeks | Years/decades |
| Problem framing | "How do I do X?" | "What system produces X?" |
| Failure response | Avoidance/shame | Data/iteration |
| Identity source | External validation | Internal conviction |
| Risk tolerance | Low/moderate | Calculated high |
| Learning mode | Instruction-based | Pattern-based |

### OSQR Assessment Questions (Sample)

**For Level Detection:**
1. "When you think about your life 10 years from now, what do you see?" (horizon test)
2. "Describe a recent failure and what you did with it." (failure response)
3. "What's your relationship with uncertainty?" (ambiguity tolerance)
4. "Who are you, in one sentence?" (identity source)
5. "What would you build if money were irrelevant?" (founder state test)

**For Stage Detection:**
1. "Do you feel like you're becoming someone new, or refining who you already are?" (Cracking vs Alignment)
2. "How stable does your sense of self feel right now?" (stage indicator)
3. "Are you in a building phase or a harvesting phase?" (expansion vs lock-in)

### How This Integrates with OSQR

1. **Onboarding Enhancement** - Add psychological assessment questions to capability level detection
2. **Adaptive Tone** - OSQR adjusts communication style based on psychological profile
3. **Stage-Aware Prompts** - Morning Strategy Calls reference current identity stage
4. **Level-Up Triggers** - Psychological breakthroughs as indicators of advancement
5. **Panel Mode Depth** - Higher psychological sophistication unlocks deeper analysis

### Technical Notes

**Potential Schema Additions:**
```
Workspace {
  identityStage String? // cracking, expansion, alignment, lock_in
  stageStartDate DateTime?
  psychProfile Json? // Structured psychological assessment data
}

PsychAssessment {
  id String
  workspaceId String
  assessedAt DateTime
  timeHorizon String // days, weeks, months, years, decades
  identitySource String // external, internal
  failureResponse String // avoidance, shame, data, iteration
  founderStateScore Int // 0-10
}
```

**Implementation Priority:**
- Phase 2: Basic psychological questions in onboarding
- Phase 3: Stage detection and tracking
- Phase 4: Full psychological profile integration

## Phase 6: Meta-OSQR Mode ("Oscar, Audit Yourself")

> **Status:** Specification complete. Build after Intelligence Layer (Phase 3) is stable.
> **Tier:** OSQR Master exclusive
> **Full Spec:** [docs/META_OSQR_MODE.md](docs/META_OSQR_MODE.md)

### Vision

Meta-OSQR is a self-refinement capability where OSQR audits its own system — applying the principle *"The best part is no part"* to itself.

**The Insight:**
> "If Oscar helps users identify unnecessary complexity in their lives, why can't Oscar turn that same thinking inward?"

### Core Capabilities

#### 6.1 System Complexity Audit
- [ ] **Analyze current state** - Map all OSQR components, features, data flows
- [ ] **Identify cruft** - Find features with low usage, redundant code paths, over-engineered systems
- [ ] **Generate simplification proposals** - "This feature could be removed. Here's the impact."
- [ ] **Track complexity over time** - Complexity score trending dashboard

#### 6.2 Question Quality Scoring
- [ ] **Rate incoming questions** - Score questions on clarity, specificity, tractability
- [ ] **Suggest question improvements** - "This question would yield better results if..."
- [ ] **Learn question patterns** - Identify what makes questions effective for each user

#### 6.3 PowerQuestion Generation
- [ ] **Analyze user's goals/projects** - Pull from PKV, MSC, profile
- [ ] **Generate high-leverage questions** - "Have you considered asking yourself: [question]?"
- [ ] **Weekly reflection prompts** - Automated thought-provoking questions

#### 6.4 Self-Improvement Proposals
- [ ] **Feature usage analytics** - Which features are actually used?
- [ ] **Code complexity metrics** - Lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, dependencies
- [ ] **UX friction detection** - Where do users abandon flows?
- [ ] **Architecture review** - "This component could be simplified because..."

### Trigger Methods

**User-Initiated:**
- "Oscar, audit yourself"
- "Oscar, what could be simpler?"
- "Oscar, show me your complexity report"

**Automated (scheduled):**
- Weekly self-audit report
- Post-release complexity check
- Monthly feature usage review

### Sample Outputs

**Complexity Report:**
```
OSQR Self-Audit Report
======================
Overall Complexity Score: 7.2/10 (up 0.3 from last month)

High-complexity areas:
1. Memory system (5 tiers when 3 would suffice)
2. Mode routing logic (nested conditionals)
3. Panel composition (over-parameterized)

Simplification opportunities:
- Memory tiers: Merge Working + Dialogue → "Session Memory"
- Mode routing: Replace conditionals with lookup table
- Panel: Remove unused 'debater' personality type

Features with <5% usage this month:
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Custom agent builder (0.2% of users)
- Voice input mode
```

**PowerQuestion Generation:**
```
Based on your current projects and goals, consider:

1. "What would this look like if it were easy?"
   → Related to: VoiceQuote scaling challenges

2. "If I could only keep 3 features, which would they be?"
   → Related to: Product roadmap decisions

3. "What am I avoiding that I know I should do?"
   → Related to: Recurring patterns in your reflections
```

### Technical Implementation

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] Behavioral Intelligence Layer (Phase 3.0) operational
- [ ] Usage telemetry flowing (TelemetryCollector active)
- [ ] Pattern detection working (PatternAggregator)

**New Components:**
- [ ] `lib/meta/SelfAuditor.ts` - Core audit logic
- [ ] `lib/meta/ComplexityAnalyzer.ts` - Code/feature complexity scoring
- [ ] `lib/meta/QuestionIntelligence.ts` - Question quality & generation
- [ ] `lib/meta/index.ts` - Clean exports

**Database Additions:**
```
ComplexityReport {
  id String
  generatedAt DateTime
  overallScore Float
  componentScores Json
  simplificationProposals Json
  lowUsageFeatures String[]
}

QuestionScore {
  id String
  workspaceId String
  questionText String (hashed)
  clarityScore Float
  specificityScore Float
  tractabilityScore Float
  improvedVersion String?
  createdAt DateTime
}
```

### Why Phase 6 (Not Earlier)

1. **Requires telemetry data** - Can't audit without usage patterns
2. **Requires pattern detection** - PatternAggregator must be operational
3. **Recursive complexity** - Adding meta-features adds complexity; must be mature enough to handle it
4. **Brand positioning** - "AI that audits itself" is powerful marketing after core value proven

### The Meta-Irony

> Building a feature that identifies unnecessary features is itself a risk of unnecessary complexity.
> The implementation must be minimal, or Meta-OSQR will be the first thing Meta-OSQR recommends removing.

## Phase 7: Creator Marketplace (V2.0)

> **Status:** Vision documented. Implementation follows V1.5 Intelligence Layer completion.
> **Prerequisites:** Core OSQR app launched, TIL/Proactive systems stable, PKV/MSC battle-tested

### Vision

The Creator Marketplace enables thought leaders to package their methodologies as "Judgment Profiles" — portable intelligence frameworks that change how OSQR thinks for users who install them.

### Key Documents

- **[docs/vision/CREATOR_MARKETPLACE.md](docs/vision/CREATOR_MARKETPLACE.md)** — Full marketplace architecture
- **[docs/vision/CREATOR_MARKETPLACE_GTM.md](docs/vision/CREATOR_MARKETPLACE_GTM.md)** — Go-to-market strategy

### Business Model

- 80/20 revenue split (creator keeps 80%)
- No platform favoritism — plugins compete on merit
- Fairness as competitive moat

### Creator Tiers

| Tier | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| Creator Mode | Private plugins, testing |
| Marketplace Candidate | 60-90 day account age, can submit |
| Verified Creator | Premium placement, proven results |

---

## Phase 8: VS Code OSQR (V3.0)

> **Status:** Vision documented. Implementation follows V2.0 Creator Marketplace launch.
> **Prerequisites:** Core OSQR app launched, Creator Marketplace stable, PKV/MSC battle-tested

### Vision

Make OSQR a real dev companion inside VS Code—not another prompt hack, but a tool that:
- Uses OSQR's multi-model routing (Quick/Thoughtful/Contemplate)
- Reads and writes to PKV (project context) and MSC (principles)
- Can eventually operate autonomously on well-defined tasks
- Builds toward "describe your app, OSQR builds it"

### Milestone Sequence

1. **Dev Companion v1** – Sidebar panel, Refine→Fire on code, PKV/MSC integration
2. **Autonomous Developer Mode** – Safe branch-based autonomous development (Jarvis-style)
3. **Autonomous App Builder** – Generate full app scaffolds from natural language

These are stacked. Each depends on the previous.

### Prerequisites

- [ ] OSQR core app launched and stable
- [ ] Intelligence Layer (Phase 3) complete
- [ ] PKV/MSC have real usage data from multiple projects
- [ ] Clear pricing model for extension features

### Key Differentiators vs Copilot/Cursor

- **Memory that persists** – PKV/MSC means OSQR remembers projects, decisions, and principles across sessions
- **Multi-model routing** – Not locked to one AI; uses the right model for the task
- **Integrated with life OS** – Dev work connects to broader goals via MSC
- **Learns from you** – Gets better at YOUR codebase over time

### Detailed Specs

Full specifications preserved in vision documents:
- **[docs/vision/VSCODE-DEV-COMPANION.md](docs/vision/VSCODE-DEV-COMPANION.md)** – Dev Companion v1 & Autonomous Mode specs
- **[docs/vision/AUTONOMOUS-APP-BUILDER.md](docs/vision/AUTONOMOUS-APP-BUILDER.md)** – App Builder blueprint
- **[docs/features/EXECUTION_ORCHESTRATOR_SPEC.md](docs/features/EXECUTION_ORCHESTRATOR_SPEC.md)** – Execution Orchestrator for autonomous workstream management

*Detailed implementation planning begins when prerequisites are met.*

### 8.1 Execution Orchestrator

> **Spec:** [EXECUTION_ORCHESTRATOR_SPEC.md](docs/features/EXECUTION_ORCHESTRATOR_SPEC.md)

The Execution Orchestrator transforms OSQR from a conversational assistant into an autonomous execution layer. User says "Go build it" → OSQR reads specs, spawns parallel work, collects decisions, returns "Built 3 of 4. Need your input on embedding strategy."

**Core Components:**
- **Workstream Registry** – Track parallel work across sessions
- **Dependency Graph** – Sequence work correctly based on dependencies
- **Decision Accumulator** – Never block, always collect decisions for batch resolution
- **Execution Queue** – Manage parallel VS Code sessions
- **Completion Reporter** – "Built 3/4, need input on 1"
- **Interface Handoff Protocol** – Web OSQR architects, VS Code OSQR builds

**Implementation Phases:**
- [ ] Phase 1: Workstream Registry (V3.0 Alpha)
- [ ] Phase 2: Decision Accumulator (V3.0 Alpha)
- [ ] Phase 3: Execution Queue (V3.0 Beta)
- [ ] Phase 4: VS Code Integration (V3.0 Beta)
- [ ] Phase 5: Full Orchestration (V3.0 Release)

**Dependencies:**
- Requires: VS Code Extension (this phase)
- Extends: Secretary Checklist (V1.5)
- Integrates: Memory Vault, Document Indexing, Constitutional Framework

**Key Commands:**
- `go build it` – Start all implementation-ready workstreams
- `what needs me` – List pending decisions
- `status` – Show orchestrator dashboard
- `proceed with recommendations` – Accept OSQR's recommendations for all pending decisions

---

## Phase 9: Privacy Phone (V4.0)

> **Status:** Strategic vision — long-term initiative
> **Target:** 2026-2027
> **Prerequisites:** V1-V3 complete, OSQR momentum established, resources secured

### Vision

**OSQR-the-phone isn't a phone with OSQR on it—it's OSQR manifested as a phone.**

The phone is one physical interface for the intelligence layer, the same way VS Code, web chat, and voice are interfaces. The insight: Everyone asking for a "freedom phone" is asking for hardware, but the actual moat is the OS. OSQR solves the hard part.

### The Intelligence Utility Model

OSQR isn't a phone company. Not even a software company. It's an **intelligence utility**—like electricity or internet, but for cognitive augmentation. Users subscribe to a *relationship* with an intelligence that knows them and improves over time. The phone is the first always-on container for that relationship.

### Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ultra-secure smartphone market (2024) | $4.15 billion |
| Projected (2033) | $20.43 billion |
| CAGR | 18.42% |
| Consumer privacy segment | Underserved |

### Business Model: The Tesla Model Inverted

**The phone isn't the product—OSQR is the product.**

The phone is an acquisition channel and hardware interface. Can price phone aggressively because capturing **lifetime subscription value**.

| Phase | Revenue Model |
|-------|---------------|
| Months 0-24 | ~$70/month bundled (~$50 hardware + ~$20 OSQR) |
| Month 25+ | Hardware paid off, OSQR subscription continues ($20-30/month) |

By month 24: 2 years of context and memory in OSQR. Switching cost is enormous—not because trapped, but because value is non-transferable.

### Data & Lapse Policy ("Florida Homestead" Philosophy)

**User data belongs to user. Never deleted.**

- If subscription lapses: OSQR intelligence **disabled, not deleted**
- User data persists indefinitely
- Base phone functions always work
- Creates trust and frictionless re-activation

### Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation (Pre-V4.0):** Complete V1-V3, establish OSQR momentum, research hardware partnerships
2. **Design (V4.0 Planning):** Hardware partner selection, OS customization, carrier exploration
3. **Development (V4.0 Build):** Mobile OS integration, prototyping, security certification, beta testing
4. **Launch (V4.0 Release):** Limited release to power users, iterate, scale manufacturing

### Detailed Specs

Full specifications preserved in vision document:
- **[docs/vision/PRIVACY-PHONE.md](docs/vision/PRIVACY-PHONE.md)** – Complete V4.0 strategic vision

*This is a post-V3.0 initiative. Execution begins after VS Code OSQR stability.*

---

## Phase 10: Robotics Integration (V5.0)

> **Status:** Placeholder — strategic vision not yet defined
> **Target:** TBD
> **Prerequisites:** V1-V4 complete, Privacy Phone launched

### Vision

OSQR intelligence layer extended to robotics and automation systems. Strategic direction and detailed specifications to be developed.

> **Note:** This is a future vision placeholder. Documentation will be created when strategic direction is defined.

## Appendix D: Autonomous Developer Mode

*Trigger: Run `/autonomous` or say "run in autonomous mode"*

### Instructions for Claude

When running in Autonomous Developer Mode, follow these rules:

1. **Break the project into tasks and subtasks** - Read this ROADMAP.md and create a dependency graph
2. **Build a dependency graph** - Understand what depends on what
3. **Execute tasks in optimal order** - Parallelize where possible
4. **When a task is blocked, store the question and pivot** - Don't stop, move to the next task
5. **Only stop when no tasks remain executable** - Maximize progress before asking for input
6. **Batch all questions and deliver them together** - One interruption, not many
7. **If a missing detail is minor, make a reasonable assumption** - Document it in ASSUMPTIONS.md and keep building

### Your Goal

**Maximum forward progress with minimum interruption.**

### Checkpoint Strategy

Create git branches/tags at major milestones for rollback safety:

```
main (current stable)
  └── feature/autonomous-phase-1
        ├── checkpoint/branding-complete      # After Oscar → OSQR rename
        ├── checkpoint/see-another-ai         # After "See another AI thinks" feature
        ├── checkpoint/msc-populated          # After MSC functionality
        ├── checkpoint/auth-complete          # After authentication is working
        └── checkpoint/phase-1-complete       # After all Phase 1 items
```

### Before Starting Autonomous Mode

1. `git checkout -b feature/autonomous-phase-1` (create feature branch)
2. Read ROADMAP.md HIGH Priority items
3. Check ARCHITECTURE.md for code patterns
4. Use TodoWrite to track progress visibly

### When Blocked

Create/update `BLOCKED.md` with:
- What you were trying to do
- What information you need
- Your best guess if you had to proceed

### When Complete

1. Create a summary of all changes made
2. List any assumptions made (from ASSUMPTIONS.md)
3. Present batched questions from BLOCKED.md
4. Show `git log --oneline` of commits

### Autonomous Phase 1 Scope (Beta)

Items Claude can complete without user input:

| Task | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Oscar → OSQR branding | HIGH | Find/replace across codebase |
| "See another AI thinks" button | HIGH | Add to Quick Mode per spec |
| Fix console errors | HIGH | DialogTitle bug, etc. |
| MSC UI population | HIGH | Create sample items |
| Code cleanup/refactoring | HIGH | Follow ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Add new UI components | HIGH | Match existing patterns |
| API endpoint additions | MEDIUM | May need to clarify specs |
| Capability Ladder questions | MEDIUM | Content needs approval |
| Memory system architecture | MEDIUM | Design decisions |

### Items Requiring User Input

- Stripe pricing/products setup
- Production deployment credentials
- Content/copy decisions for user-facing text
- Major UX flow changes
- Database schema changes affecting production data

    style: string               // Communication style
  }
}
```

## Appendix F: Collaboration Layer (Future Feature)

> **Status:** End-of-list idea. Do not build until core Personal OS is fully established.
> **Timeframe:** 1-2 years out, revisit when demand naturally emerges.

OSQR may eventually support multi-user collaboration inside shared workspaces, allowing teams or partners to build, think, and plan together with OSQR acting as the shared intelligence layer. This is **not social media** — it is project-centered collaboration with AI mediation.

### Prerequisites (Must Complete First)

- Phase 4.8 Media Vault complete
- Multi-Model Architecture stable (Council Mode shipped)
- Memory Engine operational
- Tier system with billing stable
- Significant single-user adoption established

### Collaboration Phase 1 — Shared Workspaces (Async)

- Multiple users can join a single workspace (e.g., "VoiceQuote", "Playa Bowls Expansion")
- All workspace members share:
  - PKV subset scoped to that workspace
  - OSQR's summaries, insights, and project structure
  - Chat threads scoped to the workspace
- No presence indicators. No live features. Purely asynchronous.

### Collaboration Phase 2 — Live OSQR Co-Sessions (Real-time)

- Users can start a "Live Session" inside a workspace
- OSQR mediates the session:
  - Recognizes multiple humans present
  - References each person's past notes, goals, conversations, and PKV contributions
  - Facilitates shared problem-solving
- Both users see:
  - The same chat feed
  - The same document references
  - The same reasoning context
- Supports commands like:
  - `@osqr refine this idea`
  - `@teammate review this part`

### Collaboration Phase 3 — Light Presence + Minimal Messaging (Optional, Scoped)

- Only shows presence **inside shared workspaces** ("Israel is active in VoiceQuote workspace")
- OSQR may prompt:
  - "Both of you are active — start a session together?"
- Minimal messaging sidebar:
  - Not a social network
  - Not a global DM system
  - Only for workspace collaborators
- No discovery, no feed, no friends list

### NOT Planned

- ❌ No global chat system
- ❌ No friend graph
- ❌ No public posting
- ❌ No social timelines
- ❌ No open messaging between strangers

### PKV Sharing Complexity (To Be Defined)

When implementing, we'll need to solve:

- What happens when a user leaves a workspace? (Data ownership, export rights)
- Who owns synthesized insights from collaborative sessions?
- Privacy boundaries between personal PKV and shared workspace PKV
- How do we handle conflicting privacy tiers between collaborators?
- Can users "un-share" previously shared knowledge?

*Note: These questions may be clearer by the time we're ready to build this. Document decisions as they emerge.*

### Monetization Note

Collaboration features naturally unlock a **Team tier** ($XX/month/seat). Pricing TBD based on market conditions at time of development.

## Appendix G: Enterprise Tier Vision (Future)

> **Status:** Strategic vision. Documented in detail as of Dec 2024.
> **Timeframe:** V1.5 for basic multi-user (if enterprise prospect ready), V2.0+ for full features.
>
> **UPDATE December 2024:** First enterprise prospect (Roberts Resorts) identified.
> Enterprise documentation completed and moved to `docs/enterprise/`.
> See `docs/enterprise/ENTERPRISE_ROADMAP_POSITION.md` for stopping point context.

### Enterprise Implementation Status (December 2024)

**What's Working:**
- Document indexing pipeline (core feature)
- Multi-model router (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok)
- Session persistence

**What's Documented but Not Built:**
- Multi-user support (Organization/Team model) — see `docs/enterprise/specs/ENTERPRISE_TIER_SPEC.md`
- Admin dashboard — see `docs/enterprise/specs/ENTERPRISE_ADMIN_SPEC.md`
- Security documentation — see `docs/enterprise/specs/SECURITY_DOCUMENTATION.md`

**Enterprise Scope by Version:**

| Version | Features | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| V1.5 | Basic multi-user, security one-pager | Documented, not built |
| V2.0 | Admin dashboard, RBAC, usage reporting | Spec placeholders |
| V3.0+ | SSO, SOC2, dedicated infrastructure | Strategic vision |

**Key Reference Documents:**
- `docs/enterprise/ENTERPRISE_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` - Master status
- `docs/enterprise/ENTERPRISE_ROADMAP_POSITION.md` - Stopping point context
- `docs/enterprise/specs/ENTERPRISE_FEATURE_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Sales → Engineering bridge
- `docs/enterprise/roberts-resorts/` - First prospect materials

**Resume Trigger:** Enterprise prospect ready for pilot OR V1.5 cycle begins

### What Enterprise Is

OSQR Enterprise is the **organization-level operating system** — not just "more expensive Pro."

It enables:
- Coaching companies to deploy OSQR across all clients
- SaaS teams to have shared AI workflows
- Agencies to operationalize their methodologies
- Any organization to have a custom "AI brain" trained on their content

### Why Enterprise Matters

| Lever | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Revenue** | $4K-$25K/month per org vs $29-99/user |
| **Stickiness** | Org-wide adoption = high switching cost |
| **Distribution** | One enterprise deal = hundreds of downstream users |
| **Moat** | Custom agents trained on org content can't be replicated |

### Enterprise vs White-Labeling

**Enterprise is better than white-labeling because:**
- White-labeling fragments control and brand
- Enterprise preserves OSQR sovereignty
- You build one OS; clients customize on top
- No code forks, no feature divergence

### Tier Structure (Projected)

| Tier | Price | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Pro** | $29/mo | Individual creators |
| **Master** | $99/mo | Power users |
| **Enterprise** | $4,000/mo | Organizations, coaching companies |
| **Enterprise+** | $10,000-$25,000/mo | Large orgs, compliance needs |

### Enterprise Features (Phased)

**Enterprise v1 (Foundation)**
- Organization PKV (shared vaults)
- Admin dashboard (add/remove users, roles, billing)
- Team collaboration (shared conversations, projects)
- Custom organization agent
- Priority onboarding

**Enterprise v2 (Growth)**
- Cohort management (for coaching companies)
- Integration suite (Slack, Notion, HubSpot, etc.)
- Custom model routing rules
- Organization-wide behavioral intelligence

**Enterprise v3 (Platform)**
- Private deployments (SOC2/HIPAA environments)
- Org-level app builder
- Departmental agents (Sales, Marketing, Ops, Support)
- Enterprise reporting and analytics

### Prerequisites (Must Complete First)

- [ ] Core v1 shipped and stable
- [ ] Pro/Master tiers generating revenue
- [ ] Council Mode operational
- [ ] PKV proven at scale
- [ ] Basic integrations working

### The Philosophy

> **Enterprise gives organizations the power of OSQR without giving away control of OSQR.**

No fragmentation. No white-label chaos. One platform, many deployments.

### Example Use Case: Coaching Company

A coaching company like SaaS Academy could:
1. Upload all playbooks, frameworks, and SOPs to Org PKV
2. Deploy custom "Coach Agent" trained on their methodology
3. Give every client founder their own OSQR instance
4. Track cohort progress through admin dashboard
5. Scale their coaching without scaling headcount

This turns methodology into software.
